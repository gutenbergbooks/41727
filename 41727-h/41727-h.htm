<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Soon after the formation of the Folk-lore Society in 1878 my
husband planned, and has ever since been collecting for, the
compilation of a dictionary of British Folk-lore. A great deal
of the material has been put in form for publication, but at
this stage the extent of the work presented an unexpected
obstacle to its completion.</p>

<p>To print the whole in one alphabet would be more than
could be accomplished except by the active co-operation of a
willing band of workers, and then the time required for such
an undertaking, together with the cost, almost seemed to debar
the hope of ever completing arrangements for its publication.
Nevertheless, unless we have a scientific arrangement of the
enormously scattered material and a close comparison of the
details of each item of folk-lore, it is next to impossible to
expect that the full truth which lies hidden in these remnants
of the past may be revealed.</p>

<p>During my preparation of a book of games for children it
occurred to me that to separate the whole of the games from
the general body of folk-lore and to make them a section of
the proposed dictionary would be an advantageous step, as by
arranging the larger groups of folk-lore in independent sections
the possibility of publishing the contemplated dictionary again
seemed to revive. Accordingly, the original plan has been so
far modified that these volumes will form the first section of
the dictionary, which, instead of being issued in one alphabet<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_viii" id="PageI_viii">[viii]</a></span>
throughout, will now be issued in sections, each section being
arranged alphabetically.</p>

<p>The games included in this collection bear the important
qualification of being nearly all Children&#8217;s Games: that is to
say, they were either originally children&#8217;s games since developed
into games for adults, or they were the more serious
avocations of adults, which have since become children&#8217;s games
only. In both cases the transition is due to traditional circumstances,
and not to any formal arrangements. All invented
games of skill are therefore excluded from this collection, but
it includes both indoor and outdoor games, and those played
by both girls and boys.</p>

<p>The bulk of the collection has been made by myself, greatly
through the kindness of many correspondents, to whom I
cannot be sufficiently grateful. In every case I have acknowledged
my indebtedness, which, besides being an act of justice,
is a guarantee of the genuineness of the collection. I have
appended to this preface a list of the collectors, together with
the counties to which the games belong; but I must particularly
thank the Rev. W. Gregor, Mr. S. O. Addy, and Miss
Fowler, who very generously placed collections at my disposal,
which had been prepared before they knew of my project; also
Miss Burne, Miss L. E. Broadwood, and others, for kindly
obtaining variants and tunes I should not otherwise have
received. To the many versions now printed for the first time
I have added either a complete transcript of, where necessary,
or a reference to, where that was sufficient, printed versions of
games to be found in the well-known collections of Halliwell
and Chambers, the publications of the Folk-lore and Dialect
Societies, Jamieson&#8217;s, Nares&#8217;, and Halliwell&#8217;s Dictionaries, and
other printed sources of information. When quoting from a
printed authority, I have as far as possible given the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_ix" id="PageI_ix">[ix]</a></span>
words, and have always given the reference. I had hoped to
have covered in my collection the whole field of games as
played by children in the United Kingdom, but it will be seen
that many counties in each country are still unrepresented;
and I shall be greatly indebted for any games from other places,
which would help to make this collection more complete. The
tunes of the games have been taken down, as sung by the
children, either by myself or correspondents (except where
otherwise stated), and are unaltered.</p>

<p>The games consist of two main divisions, which may be called
descriptive, and singing or choral. The descriptive games are
arranged so as to give the most perfect type, and, where they
occur, variable types in succession, followed, where possible,
by any suggestions I have to make as to the possible origin
of the game. The singing games are arranged so as to give,
first, the tunes; secondly, the different versions of the game-rhymes;
thirdly, the method of playing; fourthly, an analysis
of the game-rhymes on a plan arranged by my husband, and
which is an entirely novel feature in discussing the history
of games; fifthly, a discussion of the results of the analysis
of the rhymes so far as the different versions allow; and
sixthly, an attempt to deduce from the evidence thus collected
suggestions as to the probable origin of the game, together
with such references to early authorities and other facts bearing
upon the subject as help to elucidate the views expressed.
Where the method of playing the game is involved, or where
there are several changes in the forms, diagrams or illustrations,
which have been drawn by Mr. J. P. Emslie, are inserted in
order to assist the reader to understand the different actions,
and in one or two instances I have been able to give a facsimile
reproduction of representations of the games from early
MSS. in the Bodleian and British Museum Libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_x" id="PageI_x">[x]</a></span>Although none of the versions of the games now collected
together are in their original form, but are more or less fragmentary,
it cannot, I think, fail to be noticed how extremely
interesting these games are, not only from the point of view
of the means of amusement (and under this head there can
be no question of their interest), but as a means of obtaining
an insight into many of the customs and beliefs of our
ancestors. Children do not invent, but they imitate or mimic
very largely, and in many of these games we have, there is
little doubt, unconscious folk-dramas of events and customs
which were at one time being enacted as a part of the serious
concerns of life before the eyes of children many generations
ago. As to the many points of interest under this and other
heads there is no occasion to dwell at length here, because the
second volume will contain an appendix giving a complete
analysis of the incidents mentioned in the games, and an
attempt to tell the story of their origin and development,
together with a comparison with the games of children of
foreign countries.</p>

<p>The intense pleasure which the collection of these games
has given me has been considerably enhanced by the many
expressions of the same kind of pleasure from correspondents
who have helped me, it not being an infrequent case for me to
be thanked for reviving some of the keenest pleasures experienced
by the collector since childhood; and I cannot help
thinking that, if these traditional games have the power of
thus imparting pleasure after the lapse of many years, they
must contain the power of giving an equal pleasure to those
who may now learn them for the first time.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN&#8217;S GAMES.</h2>

<h3><a name="GameI_1" id="GameI_1"></a>Accroshay</h3>

<p>A cap or small article is placed on the back of a stooping
boy by other boys as each in turn jumps over him. The first
as he jumps says &#8220;Accroshay,&#8221; the second &#8220;Ashotay,&#8221; the
third &#8220;Assheflay,&#8221; and the last &#8220;Lament, lament, Leleeman&#8217;s (or
Leleena&#8217;s) war.&#8221; The boy who in jumping knocks off either
of the things has to take the place of the stooper.&mdash;Cornwall
(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 58).</p>

<p>See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_385">Leap-frog</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_2" id="GameI_2"></a>All-hid</h3>

<p>&#8220;A meere children&#8217;s pastime&#8221; (<i>A Curtaine Lecture</i>, 1637,
p. 206). This is no doubt the game of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_284">Hide and Seek</a>,&#8221;
though Cotgrave apparently makes it synonymous with
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_306">Hoodman Blind</a>.&#8221; See Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>. It is alluded
to in Dekker&#8217;s <i>Satiromastix</i>, &#8220;Our unhansomed-fac&#8217;d Poet
does play at Bo-peepes with your Grace, and cryes All-hidde,
as boyes doe.&#8221; Tourneur, <i>Rev. Trag.</i>, III., v. 82, &#8220;A lady can
at such Al-hid beguile a wiser man,&#8221; is quoted in Murray&#8217;s
<i>Dictionary</i> as the first reference.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_3" id="GameI_3"></a>All a Row</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All a row, a bendy bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot at a pigeon and kill a crow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot at another and kill his brother;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot again and kill a wren,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that&#8217;ll do for gentlemen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;Northall&#8217;s <i>English Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 386.</p>

<p>This is a marching game for very little children, who follow
each other in a row.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Halliwell gives the first two lines only (<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>,
No. dxv., p. 101), and there is apparently no other record of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_2" id="PageI_2">[2]</a></span>
this game. It is probably ancient, and formerly of some significance.
It refers to days of bows and arrows, and the
allusion to the killing of the wren may have reference to the
Manx and Irish custom of hunting that bird.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_4" id="GameI_4"></a>All in the Well</h3>

<p>A juvenile game in Newcastle and the neighbourhood. A
circle is made, about eight inches in diameter, termed the well,
in the centre of which is placed a wooden peg four inches long,
with a button balanced on the top. Those desirous of playing
give buttons, marbles, or anything else, according to agreement,
for the privilege of throwing a short stick, with which they are
furnished, at the peg. Should the button fly out of the ring,
the player is entitled to double the stipulated value of what
he gives for the stick. The game is also practised at the Newcastle
Races and other places of amusement in the North with
three pegs, which are put into three circular holes made in the
ground about two feet apart, and forming a triangle. In this
case each hole contains a peg about nine inches long, upon
which are deposited either a small knife or some copper. The
person playing gives so much for each stick, and gets all the
articles that are thrown off so as to fall on the outside of the
holes.&mdash;Northumberland (Brockett&#8217;s <i>North Country Glossary</i>).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_5" id="GameI_5"></a>All the Birds in the Air</h3>

<p>A Suffolk game, not described (Moor&#8217;s <i>Suffolk Glossary</i>).
Jamieson also gives it without description. Compare the rhyme
in the game &#8220;<a href="#GameI_222">Fool, fool, come to School</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_392">Little Dog, I call you</a>.&#8221;<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_1">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A full description of this game could not be obtained in
each case. The <a href="#BoysTownEHeaton">Earls Heaton</a> game is played by forming a ring,
one child standing in the centre. After the first verse is sung, a
child from the ring goes to the one in the centre. Then the rest
of the verses are sung. The action to suit the words of the verses
does not seem to have been kept up. In the <a href="#BoysTownHampshire">Hampshire version</a>,
after the line &#8220;As a bird upon a tree,&#8221; the two children named
pair off like sweethearts while the rest of the verse is being sung.</p>

<p>It appears by the analysis that all the incidents of the <a href="#BoysTownHampshire">Hants
version</a> of this game occur in one or other of the versions,
and these incidents therefore may probably be typical of the
game. This view would exclude the important incidents of
bride capture in the <a href="#BoysTownEHeaton">Earls Heaton version</a>; the bride having
a baby in the <a href="#BoysTownBelfast">Belfast version</a>, and the two minor incidents in
the <a href="#BoysTownDeptford">Deptford version</a> (Nos. 13 and 15 in the analysis), which
are obviously supplemental. Chambers, in his <i>Popular Rhymes
of Scotland</i>, pp. 119, 137, gives two versions of a courtship
dance which are not unlike the words of this game, though
they do not contain the principal incidents. Northall, in his
<i>English Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 363, has some verses of a similar
import, but not those of the game. W. Allingham seems to
have used this rhyme as the commencement of one of his
ballads, &#8220;Up the airy mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The game is clearly a marriage game. It introduces two
important details in the betrothal ceremony, inasmuch as the
&#8220;huddling and cuddling&#8221; is typical of the rude customs at
marriage ceremonies once prevalent in Yorkshire, the northern
counties, and Wales, while the making of the pudding by the
bride and the subsequent eating together, are clearly analogies
to the bridal-cake ceremony. In Wales, the custom known as
&#8220;bundling&#8221; allowed the betrothing parties to go to bed in
their clothes (Brand, ii. 98). In Yorkshire, the bridal cake was
always made by the bride. The rudeness of the dialogue
seems to be remarkably noticeable in this game.</p>

schools. The same as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_198">Drop Handkerchief</a>,&#8221; except that the
penalty for not following exactly the course of the child pursued
is to &#8220;stand in the circle, face out, all the game afterwards;
if she succeed in catching the one, the one caught
must so stand, and the other take up the cap and go round
as before&#8221; (Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>). No explanation
is given of the name of this game.</p>

games, and Halliwell-Phillips mentions it as a marching game.
The three first versions have something of the nature of an

belong to another game altogether. It is not clear from the
great variation in the verses to which class the game
belongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_10" id="PageI_10">[10]</a></span>(<i>b</i>) Mr. Ballantyne describes the dance as taking place at
the end of a country ball. The lads all sat on one side and
the girls on the other. It began with a boy taking a handkerchief
and dancing before the girls, singing the first verse
(<a href="#Fig010">fig. 1</a>). Selecting one of the girls, he threw the handkerchief
into her lap, or put it round her neck, holding both ends himself.
Some spread the handkerchief on the floor at the feet of
the girl. The object in either case was to secure a kiss, which,
however, was not given without a struggle, the girls cheering
their companion at every unsuccessful attempt which the boy
made (<a href="#Fig010">fig. 2</a>). A girl then took the handkerchief, singing the
next verse (<a href="#Fig010">fig. 3</a>), and having thrown the handkerchief to one
of the boys, she went off to her own side among the girls,
and was pursued by the chosen boy (<a href="#Fig010">fig. 4</a>). When all were
thus paired, they formed into line, facing each other, and
danced somewhat like the country dance of Sir Roger.</p>

</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Chambers&#8217; <i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 36, gives a slightly
different version of the verses, and says they were sung by
children at their sports in Glasgow. Mactaggart alludes to this
game as &#8220;&#8216;Bumpkin Brawly,&#8217; an old dance, the dance which
always ends balls; the same with the &#8216;Cushion&#8217; almost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tune of this song is always played to the dance, says
Mactaggart, but he does not record the tune. <i>To bab</i>, in
Lowland Scottish, is defined by Jamieson to mean &#8220;to play
backward and forward loosely; to dance.&#8221; Hence he adds,
&#8220;Bab at the bowster, or Bab wi&#8217; the bowster, a very old
Scottish dance, now almost out of use; formerly the last dance
at weddings and merry-makings.&#8221; Mr. Ballantyne says that a
bolster or pillow was at one time always used. One correspondent
of <i>N. and Q.</i>, ii. 518, says it is now (1850) danced
with a handkerchief instead of a cushion as formerly, and no
words are used, but later correspondents contradict this. See
also <i>N. and Q.</i>, iii. 282.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Two important suggestions occur as to this game.
First, that the dance was originally the indication at a marriage
ceremony for the bride and bridegroom to retire with &#8220;the
bowster&#8221; to the nuptial couch. Secondly, that it has degenerated
in Southern Britain to the ordinary &#8220;<a href="#GameI_198">Drop Handkerchief</a>&#8221;
games of <a href="#GameI_368">kiss in the ring</a>. The preservation of this &#8220;Bab at
the Bowster&#8221; example gives the clue both to the origin of the
present game in an obsolete marriage custom, and to the
descent of the game to its latest form. See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_177">Cushion Dance</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A rude kind of &#8220;Cricket,&#8221; played with a bat and a ball,
usually with wall toppings for wickets. &#8220;Bad&#8221; seems to be the
pronunciation or variation of &#8220;Bat.&#8221; Halliwell says it was a
rude game, formerly common in Yorkshire, and probably resembling
the game of &#8220;Cat.&#8221; There is such a game played
now, but it is called &#8220;Pig.&#8221;&mdash;Easther&#8217;s <i>Almondbury Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_17" id="GameI_17"></a>Badger the Bear</h3>

<p>A rough game, sometimes seen in the country. The boy
who personates the Bear performs his part on his hands and
knees, and is prevented from getting away by a string. It is the
part of another boy, his Keeper, to defend him from the attacks
of the others.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>This is a boys&#8217; game, and is called &#8220;Buffet the Bear.&#8221; It
may be taken part in by any number. One boy&mdash;the Bear&mdash;goes
down on all fours, and lowers his head towards his breast
as much as possible. Into his hand is placed one end of a
piece of cord, and another boy, called the Keeper, takes hold
of the other end in one hand, while he has in the other his cap.
The other boys stand round, some with their caps in hand,
and others with their neckties or pocket-handkerchiefs, and on
a given signal they rush on the Bear and pelt him, trying
specially to buffet him about the ears and face, whilst the
Keeper does his best to protect his charge. If he happens to
strike a boy, that boy becomes the Bear, and the former Bear
becomes the Keeper, and so on the game goes.&mdash;Keith, Banffshire
(Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>I saw this game played on Barnes Green, Surrey, on 25th
August 1892. The boys, instead of using their hats, had
pieces of leather tied to a string, with which they struck the
Bear on the back. They could only begin when the Keeper
cried, &#8220;My Bear is free.&#8221; If they struck at any other time, the
striker became the Bear. It is called &#8220;Baste the Bear.&#8221;&mdash;A. B.
Gomme.</p>

<p>Chambers (<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 128) describes this game
under the title of &#8220;The Craw.&#8221; It was played precisely in the
same way as the Barnes game. The boy who holds the end
of the long strap has also a hard twisted handkerchief, called
the <i>cout</i>; with this cout he defends the Craw against the
attacks of the other boys, who also have similar couts. Before
beginning, the Guard of the Craw must call out<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Jamieson defines &#8220;Badger-reeshil&#8221; as a severe blow;

Gomme). Strutt describes a handball game played during the
Easter holidays for Tansy cakes (<i>Sports</i>, p. 94). Halliwell gives
rhymes for ball divination (<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 298) to determine
the number of years before marriage will arrive. Miss Baker
(<i>Northamptonshire Glossary</i>) says, &#8220;The May garland is suspended
by ropes from the school-house to an opposite tree, and
the Mayers amuse themselves by throwing balls over it. A
native of Fotheringay, Mr. C. W. Peach,&#8221; says Miss Baker,
&#8220;has supplied me with the reminiscences of his own youth.
He says the May garland was hung in the centre of the street,
on a rope stretched from house to house. Then was made the
trial of skill in tossing balls (small white leather ones) through
the framework of the garland, to effect which was a triumph.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>This is a boys&#8217; game. The players may be of any number.
They place their caps or bonnets in a row. One of the boys
takes a ball, and from a fixed point, at a few yards&#8217; distance
from the bonnets, tries to throw it into one of the caps (<a href="#Fig014">fig. 1</a>).
If the ball falls into the cap, all the boys, except the one into
whose cap the ball has fallen, run off. The boy into whose
cap the ball has been thrown goes up to it, lifts the ball from
it, and calls out &#8220;Stop!&#8221; The other boys stop. The boy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_15" id="PageI_15">[15]</a></span>
the ball tries to strike one of the other boys (<a href="#Fig014">fig. 2</a>). If he
does so, a small stone is put into the cap of the boy struck. If
he misses, a stone is put into his own cap. If the boy who
is to pitch the ball into the cap misses, a stone is put into
his own cap, and he makes another trial. The game goes on
till six stones are put into one cap. The boy in whose cap are
the six stones has to place his hand against a wall, when he
receives a certain number of blows with the ball thrown with
force by one of the players. The blows go by the name of
&#8220;buns.&#8221; The game may go on in the same way till each player
gets his &#8220;buns.&#8221;&mdash;Nairn (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>Toone (<i>Etymological Dict.</i>) says it is a game rather for
exercise than contention; it was well known and practised in
England in the fourteenth century, and is mentioned as one of
the sports of Prince Henry, son of James I., in 1610. Strutt
(<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 96) gives two illustrations of what
he considers to be baloon ball play, from fourteenth century
MSS.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_24" id="GameI_24"></a>Bandy-ball</h3>

<p>A game played with sticks called &#8220;bandies,&#8221; bent and round
at one end, and a small wooden ball, which each party endeavours
to drive to opposite fixed points. Northbrooke in 1577
mentions it as a favourite game in Devonshire (Halliwell&#8217;s
<i>Dict. of Provincialisms</i>). Strutt says the bat-stick was called
a &#8220;bandy&#8221; on account of its being bent, and gives a drawing
from a fourteenth century MS. book of prayers belonging to
Mr. Francis Douce (<i>Sports</i>, p. 102). The bats in this drawing
are nearly identical with modern golf-sticks, and &#8220;Golf&#8221; seems
to be derived from this game. Peacock mentions it in his
<i>Glossary of Manley and Corringham Words</i>. Forby has an
interesting note in his <i>Vocabulary of East Anglia</i>, i. 14. He
says, &#8220;The bandy was made of very tough wood, or shod with
metal, or with the point of the horn or the hoof of some animal.
The ball is a knob or gnarl from the trunk of a tree, carefully
formed into a globular shape. The adverse parties strive to
beat it with their bandies through one or other of the goals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each boy provides himself with a button. One of the boys
lays his button on the ground, near a wall. The other boys
snap their buttons in turn against the wall. If the button
drops within one span or hand-reach of the button laid down,
it counts two (<a href="#Fig017">fig. 2</a>); if within two spans, it counts one.
When it hits the button and bounces within one span, it counts
four (<a href="#Fig017">fig. 1</a>); within two spans, three; and above three spans,
one. Each player snaps in turn for an agreed number; the
first to score this number wins the game.&mdash;Deptford, Kent, and

<p>(<i>b</i>) Two children stand together joining hands tightly, to
personate a fortress; one child stands at a distance from these
to personate the King of Barbarie, with other children standing
behind to personate the soldiers (<a href="#Fig019">fig. 1</a>). Some of the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_20" id="PageI_20">[20]</a></span>
go to the fortress and surround it, singing the first verse (<a href="#Fig019">fig. 2</a>).
The children in the fortress reply, the four first verses being
thus sung alternately. The soldiers then go to the King
singing the fifth verse (<a href="#Fig019">fig. 3</a>), the remaining verses being thus
sung alternately. One of the soldiers then goes to the fortress
and endeavours by throwing herself on the clasped hands of
the children forming the fortress to break down the guard
(<a href="#Fig019">fig. 4</a>). All the soldiers try to do this, one after the other;
finally the King comes, who breaks down the guard. The whole
troop of soldiers then burst through the parted arms (<a href="#Fig019">fig. 5</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Barley-break, or the Last Couple in Hell, was a game played
by six people, three of each sex, who were coupled by lot. A
piece of ground was then chosen, and divided into three compartments,
of which the middle one was called Hell. It was
the object of the couple condemned to this division to catch
the others who advanced from the two extremities (<a href="#Fig021">figs. 1</a>, <a href="#Fig021">2</a>),
in which case a change of situation took place, and Hell was
filled by the couple who were excluded by pre-occupation from
the other place (<a href="#Fig021">fig. 3</a>). In this catching, however, there was
some difficulty, as by the regulations of the game the middle
couple were not to separate before they had succeeded, while
the others might break hands whenever they found themselves
hard pressed. When all had been taken in turn, the last
couple was said to be &#8220;in Hell,&#8221; and the game ended.&mdash;Dekker&#8217;s
<i>Works</i>, iv. 434.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_22" id="PageI_22">[22]</a></span>Jamieson calls this &#8220;a game generally played by young
people in a corn-yard. Hence called <i>barla-bracks about the
stacks</i>, S. B.&#8221; (<i>i. e.</i>, in the North of Scotland). &#8220;One stack is
fixed on as the <i>dule</i> or goal; and one person is appointed to
catch the rest of the company, who run out from the <i>dule</i>. He
does not leave it till they are all out of sight. Then he sets
off to catch them. Any one who is taken cannot run out again
with his former associates, being accounted a prisoner; but is
obliged to assist his captor in pursuing the rest. When all
are taken the game is finished; and he who was first taken is
bound to act as catcher in the next game. This innocent sport
seems to be almost entirely forgotten in the South of Scotland.
It is also falling into desuetude in the North.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The following description of Barley-break, written by Sir
Philip Sidney, is taken from the song of Lamon, in the first
volume of the <i>Arcadia</i>, where he relates the passion of Claius
and Strephon for the beautiful Urania:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_23" id="PageI_23">[23]</a></span>Sir John Suckling also has given a description of this pastime
with allegorical personages, which is quoted by Brand.
In Holiday&#8217;s play of the <i>Marriages of the Arts</i>, 1618, this
sport is introduced, and also by Herrick (<i>Hesperides</i>, p. 44).
Barley-break is several times alluded to in Massinger&#8217;s plays:
see the <i>Dramatic Works of Philip Massinger</i>, 1779, i. 167.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll run at barley-break first, and you shall be in hell&#8221;
(Dekker&#8217;s <i>The Honest Whore</i>). &#8220;Hee&#8217;s at barli-break, and
the last couple are now in hell&#8221; (Dekker&#8217;s <i>The Virgin Martir</i>).
See Gifford&#8217;s <i>Massinger</i>, i. 104, edit. 1813. See also Browne&#8217;s
<i>Britannia&#8217;s Pastorals</i>, published in 1614, Book I., Song 3, p. 76.</p>

<p>Randle Holme mentions this game as prevailing in his day
in Lancashire. Harland and Wilkinson believe this game to
have left its traces in Yorkshire and Lancashire. A couple
link hands and sally forth from <i>home</i>, shouting something like</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aggery, ag, ag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ag&#8217;s gi&#8217;en warning,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and trying to tick or touch with the free hand any of the boys
running about separately. These latter try to slip behind the
couple and throw their weight on the joined hands to separate
them without being first touched or ticked; and if they sunder
the couple, each of the severed ones has to carry one home on
his back. Whoever is touched takes the place of the toucher
in the linked couple (<i>Legends of Lancashire</i>, p. 138). The
modern name of this game is &#8220;Prison Bars&#8221; (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 141).
There is also a description of the game in a little tract called
<i>Barley Breake; or, A Warning for Wantons</i>, 1607. It is mentioned
in Wilbraham&#8217;s <i>Cheshire Glossary</i> as &#8220;an old Cheshire
game.&#8221; Barnes, in his <i>Dorsetshire Glossary</i>, says he has seen
it played with one catcher on hands and knees in the small
ring (Hell), and the others dancing round the ring crying
&#8220;Burn the wold witch, you barley breech.&#8221; Holland (<i>Cheshire
Glossary</i>) also mentions it as an old Cheshire game.</p>

<p>A number of boys agree to play at this game, and sides are
picked. Five, for example, play on each side. A square is
chalked out on a footpath by the side of a road, which is called
the &#8220;Den;&#8221; five of the boys remain by the side of the Den, one
of whom is called the &#8220;Tenter;&#8221; the Tenter has charge of the
Den, and he must always stand with one foot in the Den and the
other upon the road; the remaining five boys go out to field,
it being agreed beforehand that they shall only be allowed
to run within a prescribed area, or in certain roads or streets
(<a href="#Fig025">fig. 1</a>). As soon as the boys who have gone out to field have
reached a certain distance&mdash;there is no limit prescribed&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_26" id="PageI_26">[26]</a></span>
shout &#8220;Relievo,&#8221; and upon this signal the four boys standing
by the side of the Den pursue them, leaving the Tenter in charge
of the Den (<a href="#Fig025">fig. 2</a>). When a boy is caught he is taken to the
Den, where he is obliged to remain, unless the Tenter puts both
his feet into the Den, or takes out the one foot which he ought
always to keep in the Den. If the Tenter is thus caught
tripping, the prisoner can escape from the Den. If during the
progress of the game one of the boys out at field runs through
the Den shouting &#8220;Relievo&#8221; without being caught by the
Tenter, the prisoner is allowed to escape, and join his comrades
at field. If one of the boys out at field is tired, and comes to
stand by the side of the Den, he is not allowed to put his foot
into the Den. If he does so the prisoner calls out, &#8220;There are
two Tenters,&#8221; and escapes if he can (<a href="#Fig025">fig. 3</a>). When all the boys
out at field have been caught and put into the Den, the process
is reversed&mdash;the boys who have been, as it were, hunted, taking
the place of the hunters. Sometimes the cry is &#8220;Delievo,&#8221;
and not &#8220;Relievo.&#8221; One or two variations occur in the playing
of this game. Sometimes the Tenter, instead of standing with
one foot in the Den, stands as far off the prisoner as the
prisoner can spit. The choosing of sides is done by tossing.
Two boys are selected to toss. One of them throws up his
cap, crying, &#8220;Pot!&#8221; or &#8220;Lid!&#8221; which is equivalent to &#8220;<a href="#GameI_270">Heads
and Tails</a>.&#8221; If, when a prisoner is caught, he cries out
&#8220;Kings!&#8221; or &#8220;Kings to rest!&#8221; he is allowed to escape. The
game is a very rough one.&mdash;Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form long trains, standing one behind the
other. They march and sing the first four lines, then the fifth
line, when they stand and begin again as before.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Miss Burne suggests a connection with the old pack-horses.
Mr. Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) gives the first two
lines as a game. He says, &#8220;The first horse in a team conveying
lead to be smelted wore bells, and was called the bell-horse.&#8221;
I remember when a child the two first lines being
used to start children a race (A. B. G.). Chambers (<i>Pop.
Rhymes</i>, p. 148) gives a similar verse, used for starting a race:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>and these lines are also used for the same purpose in Cheshire
(Holland&#8217;s <i>Glossary</i>) and Somersetshire (Elworthy&#8217;s <i>Glossary</i>).
Halliwell, on the strength of the corrupted word &#8220;Bellasay,&#8221;
connects the game with a proverbial saying applied to the family
of Bellasis; but there is no evidence of such a connection
except the word-corruption. The rhyme occurs in <i>Gammer
Gurton&#8217;s Garland</i>, 1783, the last words of the second line
being &#8220;time to away.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the <a href="#BingoMonton">Lancashire version</a>, one child represents the Miller.
The rest of the children stand round in a circle, with the Miller
in the centre. All dance round and sing the verses. When
it comes to the spelling part of the rhyme, the Miller points
at one child, who must call out the right letter. If the child
fails to do this she becomes Miller. In the <a href="#BingoDrayton">Shropshire version</a>,
a ring is formed with one player in the middle. They dance
round and sing the verses. When it comes to the spelling part,
the girl in the middle cries B, and signals to another, who says
I, the next to her N, the third G, the fourth &#8220;O! his name
was Bobby Bingo!&#8221; Whoever makes a mistake takes the
place of the girl in the middle. In the <a href="#BingoLiphook">Liphook version</a>, at the
fourth line the children stand still and repeat a letter each in
turn as quickly as they can, clapping their hands, and at the
last line they turn right round, join hands, and begin again.
In the <a href="#BingoTean">Tean version</a>, the one in the centre points, standing
still, to some in the ring to say the letters B.I.N.G; the letter
O has to be sung; if not, the one who says it goes in the ring,
and repeats it all again until the game is given up. In the
other Staffordshire version, when they stop, the one in the
middle points to five of the others in turn, who have to say the
letters forming &#8220;Bingo,&#8221; while the one to whom O comes has<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_32" id="PageI_32">[32]</a></span>
to sing it on the note on which the others left off. Any one
who says the wrong letter, or fails to sing the O right, takes
the place of the middle one. The <a href="#BingoMaxey">Northants version</a> follows
the <a href="#BingoMonton">Lancashire version</a>, but if the answers are all made correctly,
the last line is sung by the circle, and the game begins
again. In the Metheringham version the child in the centre is
blindfolded. When the song is over the girls say, &#8220;Point with
your finger as we go round.&#8221; The girl in the centre points
accordingly, and whichever of the others happens to be opposite
to her when she says &#8220;Stop!&#8221; is caught. If the blindfolded
girl can identify her captive they exchange places, and
the game goes on as before. The Forest of Dean and the
Earls Heaton versions are played the same as the <a href="#BingoMonton">Lancashire</a>.
In the West Cornwall version, as seen played in 1884, a
ring is formed, into the middle of which goes a child holding
a stick; the others with joined hands run round in a circle,
singing the verses. When they have finished singing they
cease running, whilst the one in the centre, pointing with his
stick, asks them in turn to spell Bingo. If they all spell it
correctly they again move round singing; but should either
of them make a mistake, he or she has to take the place of the
middle man (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 58). In the Hexham version
they sing a second verse, which is the same as the first with
the name spelt <i>backwards</i>. The <a href="#BingoEnbourne">Berks version</a> is practically
the same as the <a href="#BingoTean">Tean version</a>. The <a href="#BingoEckington">Eckington (Derbyshire)
version</a> is played as follows:&mdash;A number of young women form
a ring. A man stands within the ring, and they sing the
words. He then makes choice of a girl, who takes his arm.
They both walk round the circle while the others sing the same
lines again. The girl who has been chosen makes choice of a
young man in the ring, who in his turn chooses another girl,
and so on till they have all paired off.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The first verse of the <a href="#BingoDrayton">Shropshire version</a> is also sung at
Metheringham, near Lincoln (C. C. Bell), and Cowes, I. W.
(Miss E. Smith). The <a href="#BingoDrayton">Staffordshire version</a> of the words is
sung in Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire (Miss Matthews),
West Cornwall (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 58), Earls Heaton, Yorkshire
(H. Hardy), Hexham, Northumberland (Miss Barker),<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_33" id="PageI_33">[33]</a></span>
Leicester (Miss Ellis). Miss Peacock says, &#8220;A version is
known in Lincolnshire.&#8221; Tunes have also been sent from
Tean, North Staffs. (Miss Keary), and Epworth, Doncaster
(Mr. C. C. Bell), which are nearly identical with the <a href="#BingoSongLeicester">Leicester
tune</a>; from Market Drayton (Miss Burne), similar to the
<a href="#BingoSongDerbyshire">Derbyshire tune</a>; from Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy),
which appears to be only the latter part of the tune, and is
similar to those given above. The tune given by Rimbault is
not the same as those collected above, though there is a certain
similarity.</p>

<p>The editor of <i>Northamptonshire Notes and Queries</i>, vol. i.
p. 214, says, &#8220;Some readers will remember that Byngo is the
name of the &#8216;Franklyn&#8217;s dogge&#8217; that Ingoldsby introduces
into a few lines described as a portion of a primitive ballad,
which has escaped the researches of Ritson and Ellis, but is
yet replete with beauties of no common order.&#8221; In the <i>Nursery
Songs</i> collected by Ed. Rimbault from oral tradition is &#8220;Little
Bingo.&#8221; The words of this are very similar to the Lancashire
version of the game sent by Miss Dendy. There is an
additional verse in the nursery song.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_49" id="GameI_49"></a>Bird-apprentice</h3>

<p>A row of boys or girls stands parallel with another row
opposite. Each of the first row chooses the name of some
bird, and a member of the other row then calls out all the
names of birds he can think of. If the middle member of the
first row has chosen either of them, he calls out &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and
all the guessers immediately run to take the place of the first
row, the members of which attempt to catch them. If any
succeed, they have the privilege of riding in on their captives&#8217;
backs.&mdash;Ogbourne, Wilts (H. S. May).</p>

<p>This is a slate game, and two or more children play. One
writes the initial and final letters of a bird&#8217;s, beast&#8217;s, or fish&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_34" id="PageI_34">[34]</a></span>
name, making crosses (&times;) instead of the intermediate letters of
the word, stating whether the name is that of bird, beast, or fish.
The other players must guess in turn what the name is. The
first one who succeeds takes for himself the same number of
marks as there are crosses in the word, and then writes the
name of anything he chooses in the same manner. If the
players are unsuccessful in guessing the name, the writer takes
the number to his own score and writes another. The game is
won when one player gains a certain number of marks previously
decided upon as &#8220;game.&#8221;&mdash;Barnes (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One set of children stand against a wall, another set stand
opposite, facing them. The first set sing the first line, the
others replying with the second line, and so with the third and
fourth lines. The two sides then rush over to each other, and
the second set are caught. The child who is caught last becomes
one of the first set for another game. This is the <a href="#BlackthornEHeaton">Earls Heaton
version</a>. The <a href="#BlackthornMonton">Lancashire game</a>, as described by Miss Dendy,
is: One child stands opposite a row of children, and the row
run over to the opposite side, when the one child tries to catch
them. The prisoners made, join the one child, and assist her
in the process of catching the others. The rhyme is repeated
in each case until all are caught, the last one out becoming
&#8220;Blackthorn&#8221; for a new game. Harland and Wilkinson describe
the <a href="#BlackthornLancs">game</a> somewhat differently. Each player has a
mark, and after the dialogue the players run over to each
other&#8217;s marks, and if any can be caught before getting home
to the opposite mark, he has to carry his captor to the mark,
when he takes his place as an additional catcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_36" id="PageI_36">[36]</a></span>(<i>c</i>) Miss Burne&#8217;s version (<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 521) is
practically the same as the <a href="#BlackthornEHeaton">Earls Heaton game</a>, and Easther
in his <i>Almondbury Glossary</i> gives a version practically like the
<a href="#BlackthornSheffield">Sheffield</a>. Mr. Hardy says it is sometimes called &#8220;Black-butt,&#8221;
when the opposite side cry &#8220;Away we cut.&#8221; Miss Dendy
quotes an old Lancashire rhyme, which curiously refers to
the different subjects in the Lancashire game rhyme. It is
as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Another version is given in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd Series,
vii. 285.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This is a dramatic game, in which the children seem to
personate animals, and to depict events belonging to the history
of the flock. Miss Burne groups it under her &#8220;dramatic
games.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_55" id="GameI_55"></a>Blind Bell</h3>

<p>A game formerly common in Berwickshire, in which all the
players were hoodwinked except the person who was called
the Bell. He carried a bell, which he rung, still endeavouring
to keep out of the way of his hoodwinked partners in the
game. When he was taken, the person who seized him was
released from the bandage, and got possession of the bell, the
bandage being transferred to him who was laid hold of.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In &#8220;The Modern Playmate,&#8221; edited by Rev. J. G. Wood,
this game is described under the name of &#8220;Jingling.&#8221; Mr.
Wood says there is a rougher game played at country feasts
and fairs in which a pig takes the place of the boy with the
bell, but he does not give the locality (p. 7). Strutt also
describes it (<i>Sports</i>, p. 317).</p>

The one who blindfolds ascertains that the player cannot see
by putting the first question. When the players are satisfied
that the blindfolding is complete, the dialogue follows, and the
blind man is turned round three times. The game is for him
to catch one of the players, who is blindfolded in turn if the
blind man succeeds in guessing who he is. Players are allowed
to pull, pinch, and buffet the blind man.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) There is some reason for believing that this game can
be traced up to very ancient rites connected with prehistoric
worship. The name &#8220;Billy Blind&#8221; denoted the person who
was blindfolded in the game, as may be seen by an old poem
by Lyndsay, quoted by Jamieson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">War I ane King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sould richt sone mak reformatioun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farlyeand thairof your grace sould richt sone finde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Preistis sall leid yow lyke are bellye blinde.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And also in Clerk&#8217;s <i>Advice to Luvaris</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sum festnit is and ma not fl&eacute;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sum led is lyk the belly blynd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With luve, war bettir lat it be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;It is probable,&#8221; says Jamieson, &#8220;that the term is the same
as Billy Blynde, said to be the name of a familiar spirit or good
genius somewhat similar to the brownie.&#8221; Professor Child
identifies it with Odin, the blind deity. Another name in Scotland
is also &#8220;Blind Harie,&#8221; which is not the common Christian
name &#8220;Harry,&#8221; because this was not a name familiar in
Scotland. Blind Harie may therefore, Jamieson thinks, arise
from the rough or hairy attire worn by the principal actor.
Auld Harie is one of the names given to the devil, and also
to the spirit Brownie, who is represented as a hairy being.
Under &#8220;Coolin,&#8221; a curious Highland custom is described by
Jamieson, which is singularly like the game of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_40">Belly Blind</a>,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_40" id="PageI_40">[40]</a></span>
and assists in the conclusion that the game has descended from
a rite where animal gods were represented. Sporting with
animals before sacrificing them was a general feature at these
rites. It is known that the Church opposed the people imitating
beasts, and in this connection it is curious to note that
in South Germany the game is called <i>blind bock</i>, i. e., &#8220;blind
goat,&#8221; and in German <i>blinde kuhe</i>, or &#8220;blind cow.&#8221; In Scotland,
one of the names for the game, according to A. Scott&#8217;s
poems, was &#8220;<a href="#GameI_85">Blind Buk</a>&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blind buk! but at the bound thou schutes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And them forbeirs that the rebutes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may therefore be conjectured that the person who was hoodwinked
assumed the appearance of a goat, stag, or cow by
putting on the skin of one of those animals.</p>

<p>He who is twice crowned or touched on the head by the
taker or him who is hoodwinked, instead of once only, according
to the law of the game, is said to be <i>brunt</i> (burned), and regains
his liberty.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_60" id="GameI_60"></a>Blind Man&#8217;s Stan</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game, played with the eggs of small birds. The eggs
are placed on the ground, and the player who is blindfolded
takes a certain number of steps in the direction of the eggs;
he then slaps the ground with a stick thrice in the hope of
breaking the eggs; then the next player, and so on.&mdash;Patterson&#8217;s

<h3><a name="GameI_64" id="GameI_64"></a>Block, Haimmer (Hammer), and Nail</h3>

<p>This is a boys&#8217; game, and requires seven players. One boy,
the Block, goes down on all fours; another, the Nail, does the
same behind the Block, with his head close to his <i>a posteriori</i>
part. A third boy, the Hammer, lies down on his back behind
the two. Of the remaining four boys one stations himself at
each leg and one at each arm of the Hammer, and he is thus
lifted. He is swung backwards and forwards three times in
this position by the four, who keep repeating &#8220;Once, twice,
thrice.&#8221; When the word &#8220;Thrice&#8221; is repeated, the <i>a posteriori</i>
part of the Hammer is knocked against the same part of the
Nail. Any number of knocks may be given, according to the
humour of the players.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>A fellow lies on all fours&mdash;this is the Block; one steadies
him before&mdash;this is the Study; a third is made a Hammer of,
and swung by boys against the Block (Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian
Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>). Patterson (<i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>) mentions
a game, &#8220;Hammer, Block, and Bible,&#8221; which is probably
the same game.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_65" id="GameI_65"></a>Blow-point</h3>

<p>Strutt considers this to have been a children&#8217;s game, played
by blowing an arrow through a trunk at certain numbers by
way of lottery (<i>Sports</i>, p. 403). Nares says the game was
blowing small pins or points against each other, and probably
not unlike &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_73">Push-pin</a>.&#8221; Marmion in his <i>Antiquary</i>, 1641,
says: &#8220;I have heard of a nobleman that has been drunk with
a tinker, and of a magnifico that has played at blow-point.&#8221;
In the <i>Comedy of Lingua</i>, 1607, act iii., sc. 2, Anamnestes introduces
Memory as telling &#8220;how he played at blowe-point with
Jupiter when he was in his side-coats.&#8221; References to this
game are also made in <i>Apollo Shroving</i>, 1627, p. 49; and see
Hawkins&#8217; <i>English Drama</i>, iii. 243.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_66" id="GameI_66"></a>Bob Cherry</h3>

<p>A children&#8217;s game, consisting in jumping at cherries above
their heads and trying to catch them with their mouths
(Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>). It is alluded to in Herrick&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_42" id="PageI_42">[42]</a></span>
<i>Hesperides</i> as &#8220;Chop Cherry.&#8221; Major Lowsley describes the
game as taking the end of a cherry-stalk between the teeth,
and holding the head perfectly level, trying to get the cherry
into the mouth without using the hands or moving the head
(<i>Berkshire Glossary</i>). It is also mentioned in Peacock&#8217;s
<i>Manley and Corringham Glossary</i>. Strutt gives a curious
<a href="#IlloBobCherry">illustration</a> of the game in his <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, which is
here reproduced from the original MS. in the British Museum.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One boy lies down and personates Booman. Other boys
form a ring round him, joining hands and alternately raising
and lowering them, to imitate bell-pulling, while the girls who
play sit down and weep. The boys sing the first verse. The
girls seek for daisies or any wild flowers, and join in the singing
of the second verse, while the boys raise the prostrate
Booman and carry him about. When singing the third verse
the boys act digging a grave, and the dead boy is lowered.
The girls strew flowers over the body. When finished another
boy becomes Booman.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is clearly dramatic, to imitate a funeral. Mr.
Doe writes, &#8220;I have seen somewhere [in Norfolk] a tomb with

<p>This rhyme is repeated when it is decided to begin any
game, as a general call to the players. The above writer says<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_45" id="PageI_45">[45]</a></span>
it occurs in a very ancient MS., but does not give any reference
to it. Halliwell quotes the four first lines, the first line reading
&#8220;Boys and girls,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Boys, boys,&#8221; from a curious
ballad written about the year 1720, formerly in the possession
of Mr. Crofton Croker (<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>). Chambers also
gives this rhyme (<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 152).</p>

<p>A game at marbles. The boys have a board a foot long,
four inches in depth, and an inch (or
so) thick, with squares as in the <a href="#Fig045">diagram</a>;
any number of holes at the
ground edge, numbered irregularly.
The board is placed firmly on the ground, and each player
bowls at it. He wins the number of marbles denoted by the
figure above the opening through which his marble passes. If
he misses a hole, his marble is lost to the owner of the Bridgeboard.&mdash;Earls
Heaton (Herbert Hardy). [The owner or keeper
of the Bridgeboard presumably pays those boys who succeed
in winning marbles.]</p>

<p>Ebenezer is sent out of the room, and the remainder choose

out of the room is the person to be chosen. The medium left in
the room causes the others to think of this person without letting
them know that they are not choosing of their own free will.
The medium then says, &#8220;Brother Ebenezer, come in,&#8221; and asks
him in succession, &#8220;Was it William, or Jane,&#8221; &amp;c., mentioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_46" id="PageI_46">[46]</a></span>

<h3><a name="GameI_80" id="GameI_80"></a>Buck, Buck</h3>

<p>A boy stoops so that his arms rest on a table; another boy
sits on him as he would on a horse. He then holds up (say)
three fingers, and says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Buck, buck, how many horns do I hold up?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The stooping boy guesses, and if he says a wrong number
the other says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Two] you say and three there be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buck, buck, how many horns do I hold up?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the stooping boy guesses rightly the other says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Four] you say and [four] there be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buck, buck, rise up.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The boy then gets off and stoops for the other one to mount,
and the game is played again.&mdash;London (J. P. Emslie).</p>

<p>Similar action accompanies the following rhyme:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Inkum, jinkum, Jeremy buck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yamdy horns do au cock up?<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;Almondbury (Easther&#8217;s <i>Glossary</i>).</p>

<p>A different action occurs in other places. It is played by
three boys in the following way:&mdash;One stands with his back
to a wall; the second stoops down with his head against the
stomach of the first boy, &#8220;forming a back;&#8221; the third jumps on
it, and holds up his hand with the fingers distended, saying<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Buck shee, buck shee buck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many fingers do I hold up?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_47" id="PageI_47">[47]</a></span>Should the stooper guess correctly, they all change places,
and the jumper forms the back. Another and not such a rough
way of playing this game is for the guesser to stand with his
face towards a wall, keeping his eyes shut.&mdash;Cornwall (<i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, v. 59).</p>

<p>In Nairn, Scotland, the game is called Post and Rider. One
boy, the Post, takes his stand beside a wall. Another boy stoops
down with his head touching the Post&#8217;s breast. Several other
boys stoop down in the same way behind the first boy, all in
line. The Rider then leaps on the back of the boy at the end
of the row of stooping boys, and from his back to that of the
one in front, and so on from back to back till he reaches the
boy next the Post. He then holds up so many fingers, and
says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Buck, buck, how many fingers do I hold up?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The boy makes a guess. If the number guessed is wrong,
the Rider gives the number guessed as well as the correct
number, and again holds up so many, saying<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Four] you say, but [two] it is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buck, buck, how many fingers do I hold up?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This goes on till the correct number is guessed, when the
guesser becomes the Rider. The game was called &#8220;Buck,
Buck&#8221; at Keith. Three players only took part in the game&mdash;the
Post, the Buck, and the Rider. The words used by the
Rider were<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Buck, buck, how many horns do I hold up?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the guess was wrong, the Rider gave the Buck as many
blows or kicks with the heel as the difference between the
correct number and the number guessed. This process went
on till the correct number was guessed, when the Rider and
the Buck changed places.&mdash;Rev. W. Gregor.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Dr. Tylor says: &#8220;It is interesting to notice the wide distribution
and long permanence of these trifles in history when
we read the following passage from Petronius Arbiter, written
in the time of Nero:&mdash;&#8216;Trimalchio, not to seem moved by the
loss, kissed the boy, and bade him get up on his back. Without
delay the boy climbed on horseback on him, and slapped
him on the shoulders with his hand, laughing and calling out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_48" id="PageI_48">[48]</a></span>

bring him home, and there he stays until all on his side are

<p class="source">&mdash;London (J. P. Emslie).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Five or six children stand in a row. Another child
comes up to the first of the row, and strikes smartly on the
ground with a stick. The child facing him asks the first
question, and the one with the stick answers. At &#8220;strokes
his face&#8221; he suits the action to the words, and then thumps
with his stick on the ground at the beginning of the last line.
The object of all the players is to make Buff smile while going
through this absurdity, and if he does he must pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>Another version is for one child to be blindfolded, and
stand in the middle of a ring of children, holding a long wand
in his hand. The ring dance round to a tune and sing a
chorus [which is not given by the writer]. They then stop.
Buff extends his wand, and the person to whom it happens to
be pointed must step out of the circle to hold the end in his
hand. Buff then interrogates the holder of the wand by grunting
three times, and is answered in like manner. Buff then
guesses who is the holder of the wand. If he guesses rightly,
the holder of the stick becomes Buff, and he joins the ring
(<i>Winter Evening&#8217;s Amusements</i>, p. 6). When I played at this
game the ring of children walked in silence three times only round
Buff, then stopped and knelt or stooped down on the ground,
strict silence being observed. Buff asked three questions (anything
he chose) of the child to whom he pointed the stick, who
replied by imitating cries of animals or birds (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This is a well-known game. It is also called &#8220;Buffy
Gruffy,&#8221; or &#8220;Indian Buff.&#8221; The Dorsetshire version in <i>Folk-lore

<p>This seems to be an old name for some game, probably
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_59">Blindman&#8217;s Buff</a>,&#8221; Sw. &#8220;Blind-bock,&#8221; q. &#8220;bock&#8221; and &#8220;hufwud
head&#8221; (having the head resembling a goat). The sense, however,
would agree better with &#8220;Bo-peep&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="#GameI_284">Hide and Seek</a>.&#8221;&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_86" id="GameI_86"></a>Bull in the Park</h3>

<p>One child places himself in the centre of a circle of others.
He then asks each of the circle in turn, &#8220;Where&#8217;s the key of
the park?&#8221; and is answered by every one, except the last,
&#8220;Ask the next-door neighbour.&#8221; The last one answers, &#8220;Get
out the way you came in.&#8221; The centre one then makes a dash
at the hands of some of the circle, and continues to do so until
he breaks through, when all the others chase him. Whoever
catches him is then Bull.&mdash;Liphook, Hants (Miss Fowler).</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bull in the Barn&#8221; is apparently the same game. The
players form a ring; one player in the middle called the Bull,
one outside called the King.</p>

<p>Bull: &#8220;Where is the key of the barn-door?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chorus: &#8220;Go to the next-door neighbour.&#8221;</p>

<p>King: &#8220;She left the key in the church-door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull: &#8220;Steel or iron?&#8221;</p>

<p>He then forces his way out of the ring, and whoever catches
him becomes Bull.&mdash;Berrington (Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>,
pp. 519, 520).</p>

<p>Another version is that the child in the centre, whilst the
others danced around him in a circle, saying, &#8220;Pig in the
middle and can&#8217;t get out,&#8221; replies, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my key but I will
get out,&#8221; and throws the whole weight of his body suddenly on
the clasped hands of a couple, to try and unlock them. When
he had succeeded he changed the words to, &#8220;I&#8217;ve broken your<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_51" id="PageI_51">[51]</a></span>
locks, and I have got out.&#8221; One of the pair whose hands he
had opened took his place, and he joined the ring.&mdash;Cornwall
(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 50).</p>

themselves one in front of the other. The hindmost supports
himself against the one in front of him, and the front one
supports himself against a wall (<a href="#Fig052">fig.</a>). They thus make an even
and solid row of their backs. The other side, the Bungs, leap on
to the backs of the Buckets, the first one going as far up the

first, and so on. If they all succeed in getting a secure place,

if he fails in kepping it he bawls out &#8220;Burly Whush;&#8221; then
the party are arrested in their flight, and must run away no
farther. He singles out one of them then, and throws the ball
at him, which often is directed so fair as to strike; then this
one at which the ball has been thrown is he who gives &#8220;Burly
Whush&#8221; with the ball to any he chooses. If the corner of a
house be at hand, as is mostly the case, and any of the players
escape behind it, they must still show one of their hands past<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_54" id="PageI_54">[54]</a></span>

a whack with the ball as leaves it dirling for an hour afterwards.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s

<h3><a name="GameI_94" id="GameI_94"></a>Buttons</h3>

<p>Two or more boys take two buttons in their right hands,
and try to throw them both into a small hole in the ground
about two yards off. The boy who succeeds in getting both
buttons in begins first next game, and takes a button as prize.
[This seems merely a mild form of marbles.]&mdash;Lincolnshire
(Rev. &mdash;&mdash; Roberts).</p>

<p>There were several games played with buttons&mdash;some on
level ground, in a ring or square; but the most approved was
with a hole dug in the earth near a wall, or near the trunk of
a large tree. The hole should be about the cavity of a small
tea-cup, the players toeing a scratched line about four or five
feet from the hole, after tossing for first innings. Each of the
players (mostly two) contribute an equal number of buttons,
say from two to ten, and of equal value or quality. The one
having first turn takes the whole of them in his hand, and by
an under-throw, or rather a pitch, endeavours to get the whole,
or as many as possible, into the hole. If all go clean into the
hole, he wins the game, and takes the whole of the buttons
started with; but if one or more of the buttons are left outside
the hole, the non-player has then the choice of selecting one
which he considers difficult to be hit, and requesting the player
to hit it with his <i>nicker</i>. This is made of solid lead, about the
size of a florin, but twice its substance, and each player is
provided with one of his own. Much judgment is required in
making this selection, the object being to make it most difficult
not only to hit it, but to prevent it being hit without being
knocked into the hole, or sending the nicker in, or sending
another button in, or even not striking one at all. In any one
of these cases the player loses the game, and the non-player
takes the whole of the stakes. In playing the next game, the
previous non-player becomes the player.&mdash;London (C. A. T. M.).</p>

<p>The following was the value of the buttons:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_55" id="PageI_55">[55]</a></span>(1.) The plain metal 3 or 4-holed flat button, called a Sinkie,
say, value 1 point.</p>

<p>(2.) The same kind of button, with letters or inscription on
the rim, valued at 2 points.</p>

<p>(3.) The small metal shank button, called a Shankie, without
any inscription, valued at 3 points; if with inscription, at 4
points; the large sizes and corresponding description were
valued relatively 4 and 5 points.</p>

<p>(4.) The small Shankies, with a crest (livery waistcoat
buttons), 6 points, and the large corresponding, 7 points.</p>

<p>(5.) The small Shankies, with coat of arms, value 8 points,
and the large corresponding, 9 points.</p>

<p>(6.) Ornamental and various other buttons, such as regimental,
official, mounted and engraved in flowers, and other designs
according to arrangement, up to 20 points.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_99" id="GameI_99"></a>Camp</h3>

<p>A game formerly much in use among schoolboys, and occasionally
played by men in those parts of Suffolk on the sea
coast&mdash;more especially in the line of Hollesley Bay between
the Rivers Orwell and Alde, sometimes school against school,
or parish against parish. It was thus played: Goals were
pitched at the distance of 150 or 200 yards from each other;
these were generally formed of the thrown-off clothes of the
competitors. Each party has two goals, ten or fifteen yards
apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line,
facing their own goals and each other, at about ten yards distance,
midway between the goals, and nearest that of their
adversaries. An indifferent spectator, agreed on by the parties,
throws up a ball, of the size of a common cricket-ball, midway
between the confronted players, and makes his escape.
It is the object of the players to seize and convey the ball
between their own goals. The rush is therefore very great:
as is sometimes the shock of the first onset, to catch the falling
ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds therefore
home, pursued by his opponents (thro&#8217; whom he has to make
his way), aided by the jostlings and various assistances of his
own <i>sidesmen</i>. If caught and held, or in imminent danger of
being caught, he <i>throws</i> the ball&mdash;but must in no case give
it&mdash;to a less beleaguered friend, who, if it be not arrested in
its course, or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries,
catches it; and he hastens homeward, in like manner
pursued, annoyed, and aided, winning the notch (or snotch)
if he contrive to <i>carry</i>, not <i>throw</i>, it between his goals. But
this in a well-matched game is no easy achievement, and often
requires much time, many doublings, detours, and exertions.
I should have noticed, that if the holder of the ball be caught
with the ball in his possession, he loses a <i>snotch</i>; if, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_57" id="PageI_57">[57]</a></span>
he be hard pressed, he <i>throws</i> it to a convenient friend, more
free and in breath than himself. At the loss (or gain) of a
<i>snotch</i>, a recommence takes place, arranging which gives the
parties time to take breath. Seven or nine notches are the
game&mdash;and these it will sometimes take two or three hours to
win. Sometimes a large football was used&mdash;and the game was
then called &#8220;Kicking Camp&#8221;&mdash;and if played with the shoes on,
&#8220;Savage Camp.&#8221;&mdash;Moor&#8217;s <i>Suffolk Words</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The sport and name are very old. The &#8220;Camping pightel&#8221;
occurs in a deed of the 30 Henry VI.&mdash;about 1486; Cullum&#8217;s
<i>Hawstead</i>, p. 113, where Tusser is quoted in proof, that not
only was the exercise manly and salutary, but good also for
the <i>pightel</i> or meadow:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In meadow or pasture (to grow the more fine)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let campers be camping in any of thine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which if ye do suffer when low is the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You gain to yourself a commodious thing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;P. 65.</p>

<p>And he says, in p. 56:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Get campers a ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To camp therewithall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ray says that the game prevails in Norfolk, Suffolk, and
Essex. The Rev. S. Arnot, in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 8th series,
vol. ii. p. 138, who was rector of Ilket&#8217;s Hall, in the county of
Suffolk, says the ball was about the size of a cricket-ball, and
was driven through a narrow goal; and from the evidence
of the parish clerk it seems certain that it was not &#8220;<a href="#GameI_224">Football</a>.&#8221;
See also Spurden&#8217;s <i>East Anglian Words</i>, and <i>County Folk-lore,
Suffolk</i>, pp. 57-59.</p>

<p>There are Upper Campfield and Lower Campfield at Norton
Woodseats. They are also called Camping fields. This field
was probably the place where football and other village games
were played. These fields adjoin the Bocking fields. In Gosling&#8217;s
Map of Sheffield, 1736, Campo Lane is called <i>Camper
Lane</i>. The same map shows the position of the old Latin
school, or grammar school, and the writing school. These
schools were at a very short distance from Campo Lane, and
it seems probable that here the game of <a href="#GameI_224">football</a> was played
(Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>). &#8220;The camping-land appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_58" id="PageI_58">[58]</a></span>
to this game occurs in several instances in authorities of the
fifteenth century&#8221; (Way&#8217;s Note in <i>Prompt. Parv.</i>, p. 60).
In Brinsley&#8217;s <i>Grammar Schoole</i>, cited by Mr. Furnivall in
<i>Early English Meals and Manners</i>, p. lxii., is this passage:
&#8220;By this meanes also the schollars may be kept euer in their
places, and hard to their labours, without that running out to
the Campo (as they tearme it) at school times, and the manifolde
disorders thereof; as watching and striuing for the clubbe
and loytering then in the fields.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_100" id="GameI_100"></a>Canlie</h3>

<p>A very common game in Aberdeen, played by a number of
boys, one of whom is by lot chosen to act the part of Canlie.
A certain portion of a street or ground, as it may happen, is
marked off as his territory, into which, if any of the other boys
presume to enter, and be caught by Canlie before he can get
off the ground, he is doomed to take the place of Canlie, who
becomes free in consequence of the capture. The game is
prevalent throughout Scotland, though differently denominated:
in Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire it is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_211">Tig</a>,&#8221; and in

<h3><a name="GameI_101" id="GameI_101"></a>Capie-Hole</h3>

<p>A hole is made in the ground, and a certain line drawn,
called a Strand, behind which the players must take their
stations. The object is at this distance to throw the bowl into
the hole. He who does this most frequently wins. It is now
more generally called &#8220;The Hole,&#8221; but the old designation is
not quite extinct. It is otherwise played in Angus. Three
holes are made at equal distances. He who can first strike
his bowl into each of these holes thrice in succession wins the
game (Jamieson). It is alluded to in <i>The Life of a Scotch
Rogue</i>, 1722, p. 7.</p>

<p>The King and Queen have a throne formed by placing two
chairs a little apart, with a shawl spread from chair to chair.
A messenger is sent into the room with a letter to the Queen,
who reads it, and joins the King in a courteous entreaty that
the bearer of the missive will place himself between them.
When he has seated himself on the shawl, up jumps the King
and Queen, and down goes the messenger on the floor.&mdash;Bottesford
and Anderly (Lincolnshire), and Nottinghamshire
(Miss M. Peacock).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This is virtually the same game as &#8220;Ambassador,&#8221; described

fellow or landsman. Between the two chairs is placed a pail
of water, into which the victim falls.</p>

castles as they may in turn knock down (Lowsley&#8217;s <i>Glossary
of Berkshire Words</i>). In London, the marble alluded to as
&#8220;balser&#8221; was called &#8220;bonsor&#8221; or &#8220;bouncer&#8221; (J. P. Emslie).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_107" id="GameI_107"></a>Cat and Dog</h3>

<p>An ancient game played in Angus and Lothian. Three play,
and they are provided with clubs. These clubs are called
&#8220;dogs.&#8221; The players cut out two holes, each about a foot in
diameter, and seven inches in depth. The distance between
them is about twenty-six feet. One stands at each hole with a
club. A piece of wood about four inches long and one inch in
diameter, called a Cat, is thrown from the one hole towards the
other by a third person. The object is to prevent the Cat from
getting into the hole. Every time that it enters the hole, he
who has the club at that hole loses the club, and he who threw
the Cat gets possession both of the club and of the hole, while
the former possessor is obliged to take charge of the Cat. If
the Cat be struck, he who strikes it changes places with the
person who holds the other club; and as often as these positions
are changed one is counted in the game by the two who
hold the clubs, and who are viewed as partners.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This is not unlike the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_181">Stool-Ball</a>&#8221; described by Strutt
(<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 76), but it more nearly resembles
&#8220;Club-Ball,&#8221; an ancient English game (ibid., p. 83). The game
of &#8220;Cat,&#8221; played with sticks and a small piece of wood, rising
in the middle, so as to rebound when struck on either side, is
alluded to in <i>Poor Robin&#8217;s Almanack</i> for 1709, and by Brand.
Leigh (<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>) gives &#8220;Scute&#8221; as another name
for the game of &#8220;Cat,&#8221; probably from <i>scute</i> (O.W.), for boat,
which it resembles in shape.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_108" id="GameI_108"></a>Cat-Beds</h3>

<p>The name of a game played by young people in Perthshire.
In this game, one, unobserved by all the rest, cuts with a knife
the turf in very unequal angles. These are all covered, and
each player puts his hand on what he supposes to be the
smallest, as every one has to cut off the whole surface of his
division. The rate of cutting is regulated by a throw of the
knife, and the person who throws is obliged to cut as deep as
the knife goes. He who is last in getting his bed cut up is
bound to carry the whole of the clods, crawling on his hands
and feet, to a certain distance measured by the one next to him,
who throws the knife through his legs. If the bearer of the
clods let any of them fall, the rest have a right to pelt him with
them. They frequently lay them very loosely on, that they
may have the pleasure of pelting.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_109" id="GameI_109"></a>Cat&#8217;s Cradle</h3>

<p>One child holds a piece of string joined at the ends on his
upheld palms, a single turn being taken over each, and by
inserting the middle finger of each hand under the opposite
turn, crosses the string from finger to finger in a peculiar form.
Another child then takes off the string on his fingers in a
rather different way, and it then assumes a second form. A
repetition of this man&oelig;uvre produces a third form, and so on.
Each of these forms has a particular name, from a fancied
resemblance to the object&mdash;barn-doors, bowling-green, hour-glass,
pound, net, fiddle, fish-pond, diamonds, and others.&mdash;<i>Notes
and Queries</i>, vol. xi. p. 421.</p>

<p>The following forms are those known to me, with their
names. They are produced seriatim.</p>

<p>
1. The cradle.<br />
2. The soldier&#8217;s bed.<br />
3. Candles.<br />
4. The cradle inversed, or manger.<br />
5. Soldier&#8217;s bed again, or diamonds.<br />
6. Diamonds, or cat&#8217;s eyes.<br />
7. Fish in dish.<br />
8. Cradle as at first.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_62" id="PageI_62">[62]</a></span>The different orders or arrangements must be taken from
the hands of one player by another without disturbing the
arrangement.&mdash;A. B. Gomme.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Nares suggests that the proper name is &#8220;Cratch Cradle,&#8221;
and is derived from the archaic word <i>cratch</i>, meaning a manger.
He gives several authorities for its use. The first-made form
is not unlike a manger. Moor (<i>Suffolk Words</i>) gives the names
as cat&#8217;s cradle, barn-doors, bowling-green, hour-glass, pound,
net, diamonds, fish-pond, fiddle. A supposed resemblance
originated them. Britton (<i>Beauties of Wiltshire</i>, Glossary)
says the game in London schools is called &#8220;Scratch-scratch&#8221;
or &#8220;Scratch-cradle.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_111" id="GameI_111"></a>Cat i&#8217; the Hole</h3>

<p>A game well known in Fife, and perhaps in other counties.
If seven boys are to play, six holes are made at certain distances.
Each of the six stands at a hole, with a short stick in
his hand; the seventh stands at a certain distance holding a
ball. When he gives the word, or makes the sign agreed
upon, all the six change holes, each running to his neighbour&#8217;s
hole, and putting his stick in the hole which he has newly
seized. In making this change, the boy who has the ball tries
to put it into an empty hole. If he succeeds in this, the boy
who had not his stick (for the stick is the Cat) in the hole to
which he had run is put out, and must take the ball. There is
often a very keen contest whether the one shall get his stick,
or the other the ball, or Cat, first put into the hole. When the
Cat <i>is in the hole</i>, it is against the laws of the game to put the
ball into it.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Kelly, in his <i>Scottish Proverbs</i>, p. 325, says, &#8220;&#8216;Tine cat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_64" id="PageI_64">[64]</a></span>

<h3><a name="GameI_112" id="GameI_112"></a>Cat after Mouse</h3>

<p>This game, sometimes called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_196">Threading the Needle</a>,&#8221; is
played by children forming a ring, with their arms extended
and hands clasped; one&mdash;the Mouse&mdash;goes outside the circle
and gently pulls the dress of one of the players, who thereupon
becomes the Cat, and is bound to follow wherever the Mouse
chooses to go&mdash;either in or out of the ring&mdash;until caught, when
he or she takes the place formerly occupied in the ring by
the Cat, who in turn becomes Mouse, and the game is recommenced.&mdash;Dorsetshire
(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 214).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Played at Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy); Clapham
Middle-Class School (Miss Richardson); and many other places.
It is practically the same game as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_198">Drop Handkerchief</a>,&#8221; played
without words. It is described by Strutt, p. 381, who considers
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_368">Kiss-in-the-Ring</a>&#8221; is derived from this &#8220;Cat and Mouse.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_113" id="GameI_113"></a>Catchers</h3>

<p>One bicken is required in this game, and at this a lad must

the sand. Another boy picks it up and asks the striker &#8220;How

within the distance named&mdash;two bats&mdash;the striker again sends
the ball away, when the question is again asked<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_115" id="GameI_115"></a>Chance Bone</h3>

<p>In Langley&#8217;s abridgment of <i>Polydore Vergile</i>, f. 1., we have a
description of this game: &#8220;There is a game also that is played
with the posterne bone in the hinder foote of a sheepe, oxe, gote,
fallow, or redde dere, whiche in Latin is called <i>talus</i>. It hath
foure chaunces: the ace point, that is named Canis, or Canicula,
was one of the sides; he that cast it leyed doune a peny, or so
muche as the gamers were agreed on; the other side was called
Venus, that signifieth seven. He that cast the chaunce wan sixe
and all that was layd doune for the castyng of Canis. The two
other sides were called Chius and Senio. He that did throwe
Chius wan three. And he that cast Senio gained four. This
game (as I take it) <i>is used of children in Northfolke</i>, and they
cal it the Chaunce Bone; they playe with three or foure of those
bones together; it is either the same or very lyke to it.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_116" id="GameI_116"></a>Change Seats, the King&#8217;s Come</h3>

<p>In this game as many seats are placed round a room as will
serve all the company save one. The want of a seat falls on
an individual by a kind of lot, regulated, as in many other
games, by the repetition of an old rhythm. All the rest being
seated, he who has no seat stands in the middle, repeating the
words &#8220;Change seats, change seats,&#8221; &amp;c., while all the rest are
on the alert to observe when he adds, &#8220;the king&#8217;s come,&#8221; or,
as it is sometimes expressed, change their seats. The sport
lies in the bustle in consequence of every one&#8217;s endeavouring
to avoid the misfortune of being the unhappy individual who
is left without a seat. The principal actor often slily says,
&#8220;The king&#8217;s <i>not</i> come,&#8221; when, of course the company ought to
keep their seats; but from their anxious expectation of the
usual summons, they generally start up, which affords a great
deal of merriment.&mdash;Brand&#8217;s <i>Pop. Antiq.</i>, ii. 409.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Dr. Jamieson says this is a game well-known in Lothian
and in the South of Scotland. Sir Walter Scott, in <i>Rob Roy</i>,
iii. 153, says, &#8220;Here auld ordering and counter-ordering&mdash;but
patience! patience!&mdash;We may ae day play at <i>Change seats, the
king&#8217;s coming</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_66" id="PageI_66">[66]</a></span>This game is supposed to ridicule the political scramble
for places on occasion of a change of government, or in the
succession.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_117" id="GameI_117"></a>Checkstone</h3>

<p>Easther&#8217;s <i>Almondbury Glossary</i> thus describes this game.
A set of checks consists of five cubes, each about half an inch
at the edge, and a ball the size of a moderate bagatelle ball:
all made of pot. They are called checkstones, and the game is
played thus. You throw down the cubes all at once, then toss
the ball, and during its being in the air gather up one stone in
your right hand and catch the descending ball in the same.
Put down the stone and repeat the operation, gathering two
stones, then three, then four, till at last you have &#8220;summed
up&#8221; all the five at once, and have succeeded in catching
the ball. In case of failure you have to begin all over
again.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In Nashe&#8217;s <i>Lenten Stuff</i> (1599) occurs the following: &#8220;Yet
towards cock-crowing she caught a little slumber, and then she
dreamed that Leander and she were playing at checkstone with
pearls in the bottom of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>A game played by children with round small pebbles (Halliwell&#8217;s

<h3><a name="GameI_125" id="GameI_125"></a>Chow</h3>

are equally divided. After the Chow is struck off by one party,
the aim of the other is to strike it back, that it may not reach
the limit or goal on their side, because in this case they lose
the game, and as soon as it crosses the line the other party
cry Hail! or say that it is hail, as denoting that they have
gained the victory. In the beginning of each game they are
allowed to raise the ball a little above the level of the ground,
that they may have the advantage of a surer stroke. This is
called the &#8220;deil-chap,&#8221; perhaps as a contraction of &#8220;devil,&#8221; in
reference to the force expended on the stroke. It may, however,
be &#8220;dule-chap,&#8221; the blow given at the &#8220;dule&#8221; or goal.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_126" id="GameI_126"></a>Chuck-farthing</h3>

<p>Strutt says this game was played by boys at the commencement
of the last century, and probably bore some analogy to
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_41">Pitch and Hustle</a>.&#8221; He saw the game thus denominated
played with halfpence, every one of the competitors having a
like number, either two or four; a hole being made in the
ground, with a mark at a given distance for the players to
stand, they pitch their halfpence singly in succession towards
the hole, and he whose halfpenny lies the nearest to it has the
privilege of coming first to a second mark much nearer than
the former, and all the halfpence are given to him; these he
pitches in a mass toward the hole, and as many of them as
remain therein are his due; if any fall short or jump out of it,
the second player&mdash;that is, he whose halfpenny in pitching lay
nearest to the first goer&#8217;s&mdash;takes them and performs in like
manner; he is followed by the others as long as any of the
halfpence remain (<i>Sports</i>, pp. 386, 387). There is a letter in
the <i>Spectator</i>, supposed to be from the father of a romp, who,
among other complaints of her conduct, says, &#8220;I have catched<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_69" id="PageI_69">[69]</a></span>

August 1821, p. 36, says &#8220;Chucks&#8221; is played with a bowl
and chucks&mdash;a species of shells (<i>Buccinum lapillus</i>) found
on the sea-shore [&#8220;bowl&#8221; here probably means a marble].
Brockett (<i>North Country Words</i>) says this game is played
by girls with five sea-shells called chucks, and sometimes with
pebbles, called chuckie-stanes. Jamieson says a number of
pebbles are spread on a flat stone; one of them is tossed up,
and a certain number must be gathered and the falling one
caught by the same hand.</p>

<p>This was danced by a boy stooping till he was nearly in a
sitting posture on the ground, drawing one leg under him
until its toe rested on the ground, and steadying himself by
thrusting forward the other leg so that
the heel rested on the ground; the arms
and head being thrown forwards as far
as possible in order to maintain a balance.
The thrust-out leg was drawn back and
the drawn-in leg was shot out at the same time. This movement
was repeated, each bringing down to the ground of the
toe and heel causing a noise like that of hammering on a lapstone.
The arms were moved backwards and forwards at the

<h3><a name="GameI_139" id="GameI_139"></a>Cob-nut</h3>

<p>The children in Yorkshire have a game which is probably an
ancient English pastime. Numerous hazel-nuts are strung like
the beads of a rosary. The game is played by two persons,
each of whom has one of these strings, and consists in each
party striking alternately, with one of the nuts on his own
string, a nut of his adversary&#8217;s. The field of combat is usually
the crown of a hat. The object of each party is to crush the
nuts of his opponent. A nut which has broken many of those
of the adversary is a Cob-nut.&mdash;Brand, ii. 411; Hunter&#8217;s
<i>Hallamshire Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game is played in London with chestnuts, and is
called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_155">Conquers</a>.&#8221; In Cornwall it is known as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_143">Cock-haw</a>.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_72" id="PageI_72">[72]</a></span>
The boys give the name of Victor-nut to the fruit of the
common hazel, and play it to the words: &#8220;Cockhaw! First
blaw! Up hat! Down cap! Victor!&#8221; The nut that cracks
another is called a Cock-battler (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 61).
Halliwell describes this game differently. He says &#8220;it consists
in pitching at a row of nuts piled up in heaps of four,
three at the bottom and one at the top of each heap. The nut
used for the pitching is called the Cob. All the nuts knocked
down are the property of the pitcher.&#8221; Alluding to the first
described form, he says it &#8220;is probably a more modern game,&#8221;
and quotes Cotgrave <i>sub voce</i> &#8220;Chastelet&#8221; as authority for the
earlier form in the way he describes it (<i>Dictionary</i>). Addy
says the nuts were hardened for the purpose. When a nut
was broken it was said to be &#8220;cobbered&#8221; or &#8220;cobbled&#8221;
(<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>). Evans&#8217; <i>Leicestershire Glossary</i> also describes
it. Darlington (<i>South Cheshire Words</i>) says this
game only differs from &#8220;Cobblety-cuts&#8221; in the use of small
nuts instead of chestnuts. George Eliot in <i>Adam Bede</i> has,
&#8220;Gathering the large unripe nuts to play at &#8216;Cob-nut&#8217; with&#8221;
(p. 30). Britton&#8217;s <i>Beauties of Wiltshire</i> gives the Isle of Wight
and Hants as other places where the game is known.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_140" id="GameI_140"></a>Cock</h3>

<p>One boy is chosen Cock. The players arrange themselves
in a line along one side of the playground. The Cock takes
his stand in front of the players. When everything is ready,
a rush across the playground is made by the players. The
Cock tries to catch and &#8220;croon&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, put his hand upon the
head of&mdash;as many of the players as he can when running from
one side of the playground to the other. Those caught help
the Cock in the rush back. The rush from side to side goes
on till all are captured. To &#8220;croon&#8221; was the essential point
in capturing. When a boy was being pursued to be taken
prisoner, his great object was, when he came to close quarters
with his pursuers, to save his head from being touched on the
crown by one of them.&mdash;Nairn (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

on one side of the playground, and the King has taken
his stand in front of them, he calls out &#8220;Rexa-boxa-King,&#8221; or
simply &#8220;Rexa,&#8221; when all the players rush to the other side.
The rush from side to side goes on till all are captured. The
one last captured becomes King in the next game.&mdash;Rev. W.

<h3><a name="GameI_141" id="GameI_141"></a>Cock-battler</h3>

<p>Children, under the title of &#8220;Cock-battler,&#8221; often in country
walks play with the hoary plantain, which they hold by the
tough stem about two inches from the head; each in turn tries
to knock off the head of his opponent&#8217;s flower.&mdash;Cornwall (<i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, v. 61).</p>

<p>In the North, and in Suffolk, it is called &#8220;Cocks,&#8221; &#8220;a puerile
game with the tough tufted stems of the ribwort plantain&#8221;
(Brockett&#8217;s <i>North Country Words</i>). Moor (<i>Suffolk Words</i>)
alludes to the game, and Holloway (<i>Dictionary of Provincialisms</i>)
says in West Sussex boys play with the heads of rib
grass a similar game. Whichever loses the head first is conquered.
It is called &#8220;Fighting-cocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>One boy is chosen as Cock. He is blindfolded, and stands
alone, with his legs as far apart as possible. The other boys
then throw their caps as far as they are able between the extended
legs of the Cock (<a href="#Fig073">fig. 1</a>). After the boys have thrown
their caps, and each boy has taken his stand beside his cap,
the Cock, still blindfolded, stoops down and crawls in search<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_74" id="PageI_74">[74]</a></span>
of the caps (<a href="#Fig073">fig. 2</a>). The boy whose cap he first finds has to run
about twenty yards under the buffeting of the other boys, the
blows being directed chiefly to the head. He becomes Cock
at the next turn of the game.&mdash;Rosehearty, Pitsligo (Rev. W.
Gregor).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_145" id="GameI_145"></a>Cockertie-hooie</h3>

<p>This game consists simply of one boy mounting on the neck
of another, putting a leg over each shoulder and down his
breast. The boy that carries takes firm hold of the legs of the
one on his neck, and sets off at a trot, and runs hither and
thither till he becomes tired of his burden. The bigger the
one is who carries, the more is in the enjoyment to the one
carried.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game is played with horse chestnuts threaded on a
string. Two boys sit face to face astride of a form or a log of
timber. If a piece of turf can be procured so much the better.
One boy lays his chestnut upon the turf, and the other strikes
at it with his chestnut; and they go on striking alternately till
one chestnut splits the other. The chestnut which remains
unhurt is then &#8220;conqueror of one.&#8221; A new chestnut is substituted
for the broken one, and the game goes on. Whichever
chestnut now proves victorious becomes &#8220;conqueror of
two,&#8221; and so on, the victorious chestnut adding to its score all
the previous winnings. The chestnuts are often artificially
hardened by placing them up the chimney or carrying them in
a warm pocket; and a chestnut which has become conqueror
of a considerable number acquires a value in schoolboys&#8217; eyes;
and I have frequently known them to be sold, or exchanged for
other toys (Holland&#8217;s <i>Cheshire Glossary</i>). The game is more
usually played by one boy striking his opponent&#8217;s nut with his
own, both boys standing and holding the string in their hands.
It is considered bad play to strike the opponent&#8217;s <i>string</i>. The
nut only should be touched. Three tries are usually allowed.</p>

&#8220;nobbly&#8221; or &#8220;knobbly,&#8221; expressing the appearance of the
string of nuts; and &#8220;onkers&#8221; was probably invented as a
rhyme to &#8220;conquers&#8221; (<i>Upton-on-Severn Words and Phrases</i>,

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed by each child holding one end of a handkerchief.
One child stands in the centre and acts as leader. The
ring moves round slowly. The leader says the words as above
while the ring is moving round, and then suddenly calls out
whichever he chooses of the two sayings. If he says &#8220;Hold
fast!&#8221; every one must immediately let go the corner of the
handkerchief he holds. They should all fall to the ground at
once. When he says &#8220;Let go!&#8221; every one should retain their
hold of the handkerchief. Forfeits are demanded for every
mistake.</p>

<p>This game, called &#8220;Hawld Hard,&#8221; is commonly played

Two players play; each has three men or flitchers. Now there

edges of the square and one at the centre. The men belonging
to each player are not set together as at draughts, but mingled
with each other. The one who has the first move may always

<h3><a name="GameI_159" id="GameI_159"></a>Cots and Twisses</h3>

<p>A flat stone is obtained called a Hob, upon which those who
are playing place equal shares of Cots and Twisses. Cots are
brass buttons, and Twisses bits of brass&mdash;a Twiss of solid
brass being worth many Cots. Each player provides himself
with a nice flat [key] stone, and from an agreed pitch tosses
it at the Hob. If he knocks off any of the Cots and Twisses
nearer to the players than the Hob is, he claims them. The
other players try to knock the Hob away with their key-stones
from any Cots and Twisses that may not have been claimed;
and if any key-stone touches Hob after all have thrown, the
owner cannot claim any Cots and Twisses.&mdash;Earls Heaton
(Herbert Hardy).</p>

<p>Each player selects a Cast or stone to pitch with; on another
stone, called the Hob, the Cots and Twys are placed; at
some distance Scops are set in the ground. First the players
pitch from the Hob to the Scop, and the one who gets nearest
goes first. He then pitches at the Hob, and if he knocks off
the stakes he has them, provided his Cast is nearer to them
than the Hob is; in failure of this, the other player tries. In
pitching up, one Cast may rest on another, and if the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_81" id="PageI_81">[81]</a></span>
whose stone is underneath can lift it up to knock the other
Cast away, it has to remain at the place to which it has been
struck; if he does not succeed in doing this, the second player
may lift off his Cast and place it by the first. Whoever
knocks off the stakes, they go to the boy whose Cast is
nearest to them. The Hob and Scop are usually three yards
apart. The Cot was a button off the waistcoat or trousers,
the Twy one off the coat, and, as its name implies, was equal
to two Cots. Formerly, when cash was much more rare than
now it is amongst boys, these formed their current coin. The
game about 1820 seems to have been chiefly one of tossing,
and was played with buttons, then common enough. Now,
metal buttons being rare, it is played with pieces of brass or
copper of any shape. The expression, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a cot,&#8221; is
sometimes used to signify that a person is without money.&mdash;Easther&#8217;s

<h3><a name="GameI_163" id="GameI_163"></a>Cricket</h3>

<p>A description of this game is not given here; its history
and rules and regulations are well known, and many books
have been devoted to its study. The word &#8220;Cricket&#8221; is given
in Lawson&#8217;s <i>Upton-on-Severn Words and Phrases</i> as a low
wooden stool. He continues, &#8220;The game of &#8216;Cricket&#8217; was
probably a development of the older game of &#8216;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_181">Stool-ball</a>,&#8217; a
dairymaid&#8217;s stool being used for the wicket.&#8221; Wedgwood
(<i>Etym. Dict.</i>) suggests that the proper name for the bat was
&#8220;cricket-staff,&#8221; A.-S. <i>criec</i>, a staff.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_164" id="GameI_164"></a>Crooky</h3>

<p>An old game called &#8220;Crooky&#8221; was formerly played at
Portarlington, Queen&#8217;s co., and Kilkee, co. Clare. Fifty years
ago it was played with wooden crooks and balls, but about
twenty-five years ago, or a little more, mallets were introduced
at Kilkee; while subsequently the name was changed
to &#8220;Croquet.&#8221; I have heard it stated that this game was
introduced by the French refugees that settled at Portarlington.&mdash;G.
H. Kinahan (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, ii. 265).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_165" id="GameI_165"></a>Cross and Pile</h3>

<p>The game now called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_270">Heads and Tails</a>&#8221; (Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>).
See <i>Nomenclator</i>, p. 299; Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>.
Strutt points out that anciently the English coins were stamped
on one side with a cross. See also Harland&#8217;s <i>Lancashire
Legends</i>, p. 139.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_166" id="GameI_166"></a>Cross-bars</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_167" id="GameI_167"></a>Cross-questions</h3>

<p>Nares (<i>Glossary</i>) mentions this game in a quotation from
Wilson&#8217;s <i>Inconstant Lady</i>, 1614. &#8220;Cross Questions and
Crooked Answers&#8221; was a popular game at juvenile parties.
The players sit in a circle, and each is asked in a whisper a
question by the one on his left, and receives also in a whisper
an answer to a question asked by himself of the person on his
right. Each player must remember both the question he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_83" id="PageI_83">[83]</a></span>
asked and the answer he received, which have at the conclusion
of the round to be stated aloud. Forfeits must be given if
mistakes are made.&mdash;A. B. Gomme.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_168" id="GameI_168"></a>Cross Tig</h3>

<p>One of the players is appointed to be Tig. He calls out the
name of the one he intends to chase, and runs after him. Another
player runs across between Tig and the fugitive, and then
Tig runs after this cross-player until another player runs across
between Tig and the fugitive; and so on. Each time a player
crosses between Tig and the player he is following he leaves
the original chase and follows the player who has crossed.
When he captures, or, in some places, touches one of the
players he is following, this player becomes Tig, and the game
begins again.&mdash;Ireland (Miss Keane).</p>

<p>This game is known in and near London as &#8220;Cross Touch.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_169" id="GameI_169"></a>Cry Notchil</h3>

<p>This is an old game where boys push one of their number
into a circle they have made, and as he tries to escape push
him back, crying, &#8220;No child of mine!&#8221; (Leigh&#8217;s <i>Cheshire Glossary</i>).
He adds, &#8220;This may be the origin of the husband&#8217;s disclaimer
of his wife when he &#8216;notchils&#8217; her.&#8221; To &#8220;cry notchil&#8221;
is for a man to advertise that he will not be answerable for
debts incurred by his wife.</p>

</div>

<p>Four or more boys can play this game, and sides are chosen.
Two holes are made in the ground at a distance of about eight
or ten feet apart. A ring about a foot in diameter is made
round each hole. A boy stands at each hole with a stick,
which he puts into the hole to guard it. Two other boys stand
behind the holes, who act as bowlers. One of these throws a
small piece of wood shaped like a Cat, and tries to pitch it into
the hole. The boy guarding the hole tries to hit it with his
stick. If he succeeds, he and the boy at the other hole run to
each other&#8217;s places. Should the boy who throws the piece of
wood succeed in getting it into the hole, the batsmen are out.
Should the Cat fall into the ring or a span beyond, one of the
bowlers picks it up, and both run to a hiding-place. They then
agree as to which of them should hold the Cat. This must be
carried in such a way that it cannot be seen by the batsmen,
both boys assuming the same attitude. Both boys then resume
their previous places. They kneel down, still keeping the same
attitudes. The batsmen, keeping their sticks in the holes,
then agree which of the two holds the Cat. One batsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_85" id="PageI_85">[85]</a></span>
runs across and puts his stick into the hole behind which the
boy kneels whom they consider has the Cat, the other then
running to his place. If they are right in their guess, the
holder of the Cat throws it across the ground for the opposite
bowler to put it in the hole before the second batsman reaches
it. If they guess wrongly, the holder of the Cat puts it into
the hole as soon as the batsman runs, and they then become the
batsmen for the next game. If the batsmen leave their holes
unguarded with the stick, the catsmen can at any time put
them &#8220;out,&#8221; by putting the Cat in a hole. If more than two
boys on a side play, the others field as in &#8220;<a href="#GameI_163">Cricket</a>.&#8221;&mdash;Barnes

<p>(<i>b</i>) This is a grotesque kind of dance, performed in a shortened
posture, sitting on one&#8217;s hams, with arms akimbo, the dancers
forming a circle of independent figures. It always excites a
hearty laugh among the senior bystanders; but, ridiculous as
it is, it gives occasion for the display of some spirit and agility,
as well as skill, there being always an inclination to topple
over. Each performer sings the verse (Chambers; Mactaggart&#8217;s
<i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>).</p>

<p>Mr. Ballantyne says that each one apart tried to dance by
throwing out their feet and jumping sideways.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The first syllable of this word is, says Jamieson, undoubtedly
the verb <i>curr</i>, to sit on the houghs or hams. The
second may be from Teut. <i>kudde</i>, a flock; <i>kudd-en</i>, coire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_86" id="PageI_86">[86]</a></span>
convenire, congregari, aggregari; <i>kudde wijs</i>, gregatim, catervatim,
q. to curr together. The same game is called <i><a href="#GameI_264">Harry
Hurcheon</a></i> in the North of Scotland, either from the resemblance
of one in this position to a <i>hurcheon</i>, or hedge-hog, squatting

</div>

<blockquote><p class="center fsize80">This music is exactly as it is printed in the book referred to.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The following is an account of the dance as it was known
in Derbyshire amongst the farmers&#8217; sons and daughters and
the domestics, all of whom were on a pretty fair equality, very
different from what prevails in farm-houses of to-day. The
&#8220;Cushion Dance&#8221; was a famous old North-country amusement,
and among the people of Northumberland it is still commonly
observed. The dance was performed with boisterous fun, quite
unlike the game as played in higher circles, where the conditions
and rules of procedure were of a more refined order.</p>

<p>The company were seated round the room, a fiddler occupying
a raised seat in a corner. When all were ready, two of
the young men left the room, returning presently, one carrying
a large square cushion, the other an ordinary drinking-horn,
china bowl, or silver tankard, according to the possessions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_88" id="PageI_88">[88]</a></span>
the family. The one carrying the cushion locked the door,
putting the key in his pocket. Both gentlemen then went to
the fiddler&#8217;s corner, and after the cushion-bearer had put a coin
in the vessel carried by the other, the fiddler struck up a lively
tune, to which the young men began to dance round the room,
singing or reciting to the music:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Frinkum, frankum is a fine song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&#8217; we will dance it all along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All along and round about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we find the pretty maid out.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After making the circuit of the room, they halted on reaching
the fiddler&#8217;s corner, and the cushion-bearer, still to the music
of the fiddle, sang or recited:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="poem" summary="Cushion Dance">

<td class="role">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="left top">Our song it will no further go!</td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>The cushion-bearer and vessel-holder then proceeded with
the dance, going as before round the room, singing &#8220;Frinkum,
frankum,&#8221; &amp;c., till the cushion-bearer came to the lady of his
choice, before whom he paused, placed the cushion on the floor
at her feet, and knelt upon it. The vessel-bearer then offered
the cup to the lady, who put money in it and knelt on the
cushion in front of the kneeling gentleman. The pair kissed,
arose, and the gentleman, first giving the cushion to the lady
with a bow, placed himself behind her, taking hold of some
portion of her dress. The cup-bearer fell in also, and they
danced on to the fiddler&#8217;s corner, and the ceremony was again
gone through as at first, with the substitution of the name of
&#8220;John&#8221; for &#8220;Jane,&#8221; thus:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<td class="left top blankbelow">An&#8217; I&#8217;ll make him whether he will or no!</td>

</table>

<p>The dancing then proceeded, and the lady, on reaching her
choice (a gentleman, of necessity), placed the cushion at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_89" id="PageI_89">[89]</a></span>
feet. He put money in the horn and knelt. They kissed and
rose, he taking the cushion and his place in front of the lady,
heading the next dance round, the lady taking him by the coat-tails,
the first gentleman behind the lady, with the horn-bearer
in the rear. In this way the dance went on till all present,
alternately a lady and gentleman, had taken part in the ceremony.
The dance concluded with a romp in file round the
room to the quickening music of the fiddler, who at the close
received the whole of the money collected by the horn-bearer.</p>

<p>At Charminster the dance is begun by a single person (either
man or woman), who dances about the room with a cushion in
his hand, and at the end of the tune stops and sings:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>And so she lays down the cushion before a man, who,

<p>Then, he taking up the cushion, they take hands and dance
round singing as before; and this they do till the whole company
is taken into the ring. Then the cushion is laid down
before the first man, the woman singing, &#8220;This dance,&#8221; &amp;c., as
before, only instead of &#8220;come to,&#8221; they sing &#8220;go fro,&#8221; and instead

<p>This description is almost the same as a seventeenth century
version. The dance is begun by a single person (either man
or woman), who, taking a cushion in his hand, dances about
the room, and at the end of the tune he stops and sings:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Children form a ring with one in the middle, who lays a
cushion on the ground. They sing the first two lines, and the
child in the centre points at one, and the others dance round
singing the other lines, the centre child dragging the imaginary
Mrs. Sargesson on to the cushion by force, kissing her, and
leaving her in the centre. Then Mrs. Sargesson points at one
in the ring, and the game begins again.&mdash;East Kirkby, Lincolnshire

<p>Miss Baker (<i>Northamptonshire Glossary</i>) says the Cushion
Dance is still continued, with some variations, and generally
closes the evening&#8217;s amusements. One of the young men
endeavours secretly to bring in a cushion, and locks the doors,
to prevent the escape of the young maidens; then all the party
unite hands and dance round three times to the left and three
times to the right, after which the company all seat themselves,
except the young man who holds the cushion. He advances
to the fiddler, and says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The cushion-holder then goes to the girl he fancies most, and
drops the cushion at her feet. She kneels down with him on
the cushion, and he salutes her, and they then rise and dance
round and round to the fiddler. The girls then go through the
same thing, saying, &#8220;young men,&#8221; and then &#8220;a young man,&#8221; &amp;c.,
until the whole company have gone through the same ceremony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_92" id="PageI_92">[92]</a></span>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Selden, in his <i>Table Talk</i>, thus refers to this game:&mdash;&#8220;The
Court of England is much altered. At a solemn dancing
first you have the grave measures, then the Cervantoes and the
Golliards, and this is kept up with ceremony. At length to
Trenchmore and the <i>Cushion Dance</i>; and then all the company
dance, lord and groom, lady and kitchen-maid, no distinction.
But in King Charles&#8217;s time there has been nothing but Trenchmore
and the Cushion Dance,&#8221; &amp;c. The &#8220;Whishin Dance&#8221;
(an old-fashioned dance, in which a cushion is used to kneel
upon), mentioned by Dickinson (<i>Cumberland Glossary</i>), is
probably the same game or dance, &#8220;whishin&#8221; meaning cushion.
Brockett (<i>North Country Words</i>) mentions &#8220;Peas Straw,&#8221; the
final dance at a rustic party; something similar to the ancient
&#8220;Cushion Dance&#8221; at weddings. It is also recorded in Evans&#8217;
<i>Leicestershire Glossary</i>, and by Burton in the following passage
from the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>: &#8220;A friend of his reprehended
him for dancing beside his dignity, belike at some
cushen dance.&#8221; In the version from East Kirkby, Lincolnshire,
the expression &#8220;in our degree&#8221; in the first line of the
verse is apparently meaningless, and it is probably a corruption
of &#8220;highdigees, highdegrees,&#8221; a dialect word for roystering,
high spirits, merriment, dancing, romping. Elworthy (<i>Somerset
Words</i>) gives this word, and quotes the following line from
Drayton:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dance many a merry round and many a highdegy.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;<i>Polyolbion</i>, Bk. xxv., l. 1162.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The transition from a dance to a pure game is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_93" id="PageI_93">[93]</a></span>
illustrated by the different versions, and the connection of the
dance with the ceremony of marriage is obvious. A curious
account of the merry-makings at marriages is given in Coverdale&#8217;s
<i>Christen State of Matrimony</i>, 1543: &#8220;After the banket
and feast there beginneth a mad and unmannerly fashion; for
the bride must be brought into an open dauncing-place. Then
is there such a running, leaping, and flinging among them
that a man might think all these dauncers had cast all shame
behinde them, and were become starke mad, and out of their
wits, and that they were sworne to the devil&#8217;s daunce. Then
must the bride keep foote with all dauncers, and refuse none,
how scabbed, foule, drunken, rude, and shameless soever he be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
After supper must they begin to pipe and daunce again
of anew. And though the young persons come once towards
their rest, yet can they have no quietness.&#8221;&mdash;1575 edit., fol. 59,
rev. 60. Edward L. Rimbault, writing in <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
vi. 586, says it was formerly the custom at weddings, both
of the rich as well as the poor, to dance after dinner and
supper. In an old Court masque of James I.&#8217;s time, performed
at the marriage ceremony of Philip Herbert and Lady Susan
(MS. in the writer&#8217;s possession), it is directed that, at the
conclusion of the performance, &#8220;after supper&#8221; the company
&#8220;dance a round dance.&#8221; This was &#8220;dancing the bride to bed.&#8221;
William Chappell (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, ii. 442) says, &#8220;I have a
tune called &#8216;A round dance to dance the bride to bed.&#8217; It
dates from about 1630, or earlier, and resembles that of &#8216;The
Hunt is up.&#8217;&#8221; Dancing was considered so essential at weddings
(according to Grose) that if in a family the youngest daughter
should chance to be married before her elder sisters, they must
dance at her wedding without shoes. May not the custom of
throwing of old and worn-out shoes after the bride have arisen
from the practice of dancing? The danced-out shoes may have
been the ones used. It is curious that the cushion is used
in the marriage ceremonies of the Brahmins. Mr. Kearns, in
his <i>Marriage Ceremonies of the Hindoos of the South of India</i>,
p. 6, says that a stool or cushion is one of the preparations for
the reception of the bridegroom, who on entering the apartment
sits down on the stool which is presented to him. He says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_94" id="PageI_94">[94]</a></span>
&#8220;I step on this for the sake of food and other benefits, on this
variously splendid footstool.&#8221; The bride&#8217;s father then presents
to him a cushion made of twenty leaves of c&uacute;sa grass, holding
it up with both hands and exclaiming, &#8220;The cushion! the
cushion! the cushion!&#8221; The bridegroom replies, &#8220;I accept
the cushion,&#8221; and taking it, places it on the ground under his
feet, while he recites a prayer. It is probable that we may
have in the &#8220;Cushion Dance&#8221; the last relics of a very ancient
ceremony, as well as evidence of the origin of a game from
custom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uneda,&#8221; at same reference (x. 17), speaks of it as a known

some savage dances is curious; a correspondent in <i>Notes and

<i>Expedition to Arctic Shores</i> (vol. i. p. 397), of a dance by
the &#8220;Kutchin-Kutcha&#8221; Indians, a parallel to the name as
well as the dance which needs some research in America.</p>

<p>Children sit in a ring or in a line, with their hands placed
together palm to palm, and held straight, the little finger down-most
between the knees. One of them is then chosen to
represent a servant, who takes a ring, or some other small
article as a substitute, between her two palms, which are
pressed flat together like those of the rest, and goes round the
circle or line placing her hands into the hands of every player,
so that she is enabled to let the ring fall wherever she pleases
without detection. After this she returns to the first child she
touched, and with her hands behind her says the above words.
The child who is thus addressed must guess who has the ring,
and the servant performs the same ceremony with each of the
party. They who guess right escape, but the rest forfeit.
Should any one in the ring exclaim &#8220;I have it!&#8221; she also
forfeits; nor must the servant make known who has the ring
until all have guessed under the same penalty. The forfeits
are afterwards cried as usual.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>,
p. 223.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game was a general favourite at juvenile parties
years ago. The hands were held in the posture described by
Halliwell, but any child was pitched upon for the first finder,
and afterwards the child in whose hands the ring was found
had to be finder. There was no guessing; the closed hands
were looked into (A. B. Gomme). Mr. Addy has collected
a similar game called &#8220;My lady&#8217;s lost a gold ring,&#8221; and Mr.
Newell (<i>Games and Songs of American Children</i>, p. 150) has
another, &#8220;Hold fast my gold ring.&#8221;<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_10">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>A singular rustic amusement. One lays his hand down on
a table, another clashes his upon it, a third his on that, and so
on (<a href="#Fig097">fig. 1</a>). When all the players have done this, the one who
has his hand on the board pulls it out and lays it on the one
uppermost (<a href="#Fig097">fig. 2</a>): they all follow in rotation, and so a continual
clashing and dashing is kept up; hence the name
&#8220;Dish.&#8221; Those who win the game are those who stand out<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_98" id="PageI_98">[98]</a></span>
longest&mdash;viz., those who are best at enduring pain. Tender
hands could not stand it a moment: one dash of a rustic
&#8220;loof&#8221; would make the blood spurt from the tip of every
finger. It is a piece of pastime to country lads of the same
nature as &#8220;Hard Knuckles&#8221; (Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>).
This is a well-known game for small children in
London. After each child&#8217;s hands have been withdrawn and
replaced on top as many times as possible without deranging
the order, a general scramble and knocking of hands together
ends the game (A. B. Gomme). Jamieson (<i>Etymological Dict.</i>)
gives this as a sport of children.</p>

to one of two opposite hedges&mdash;the alley, hail-goal, or boundary.

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form a ring by joining hands, one child
standing in the centre. They dance round. At the mention of
the second name one from the ring goes into the centre. The
two kiss at the end of the verse, and the first child takes the
place in the ring, and the game begins again.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <a href="#DrawPailBerrington">Berrington version</a> of this game is played as
follows:&mdash;Two girls face each other, holding each other by
both hands. Two others face each other, holding both hands
across the other two. They see-saw backwards and forwards,
singing the lines (<a href="#Fig103">fig. 1</a>). One girl gets inside the enclosing
hands (<a href="#Fig103">fig. 2</a>), and they repeat till all four have &#8220;popped
under&#8221; (<a href="#Fig103">fig. 3</a>), when they &#8220;jog&#8221; up and down till they fall on
the floor! (<a href="#Fig103">fig. 4</a>). At <a href="#DrawPailBerrington">Ellesmere</a> only <i>two</i> girls join hands,
and as many &#8220;pop under&#8221; as they can encircle. The
<a href="#DrawPailAnderby">Lincolnshire</a> and <a href="#DrawPailSporle1">Norfolk versions</a> are played practically in
the same way. In the <a href="#DrawPailLiphook">Liphook version</a> the children stand
in two and two opposite to each other; the children on<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_104" id="PageI_104">[104]</a></span>
one side of the square hold hands up at the third line,
and the other two children run under the hands of the first
two. There is no pause, but the verse is sung time after time,
so that the four children are nearly always moving. In the
other <a href="#DrawPailHampshire">Hampshire version</a> four girls stand in a square, each
holding the hands of the one opposite to her, pulling each
other&#8217;s hands backwards and forwards singing the lines. Two
arms are then raised, and one girl comes under; this is repeated
till all four girls have come under the arms, then
their arms encircle each other&#8217;s waists and they dance round.
In the <a href="#DrawPailFochabers">Scottish version</a> there are only two girls who join hands
and pull each other backwards and forwards, repeating the
words. <a href="#DrawPailHalliwell1">Halliwell</a> describes a different action to any of these.
A string of children, hand in hand, stand in a row. A child
stands in front of them as leader; two other children form
an arch, each holding both of the hands of the other. The
string of children pass under the arch, the last of whom is
taken captive by the two holding hands. The verses are
repeated until all are taken.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>,

having come down with only two of the incidents, namely, the
two most common to all the variants (12 and 14), shows that
the game has been in a state of decadence. The four principal
incidents, Nos. 1, 4, 12, and 14, point distinctly to some water
ceremonial; and if it may be argued that the incidents which
occur in only one or two of the variants may be considered to
have belonged to the original type, we shall be able to suggest
that this game presents a dramatic representation of ancient
well-worship. The incidents which occur in one version only
are those given by Mr. Halliwell, and unfortunately the locality
from which he obtained this variant is unknown. Still it is an
earlier version than those which are now printed for the first
time, and may without doubt be looked upon as genuine.
Taking all the incidents of the various versions as the means
by which to restore the earliest version, it would appear that
this might have consisted of the following lines:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Draw a pail of water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a lady&#8217;s daughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her father&#8217;s a king, her mother&#8217;s a queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her two little sisters are dressed in green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stamping grass and parsley, marigold leaves and daisies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sift the lady&#8217;s oatmeal, sift it into flour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put it in a chestnut tree, let it lie an hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give a silver pin and a gold ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One and a hush! two and a rush!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray, young lady, pop under a bush;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bush is too high, my bush is too low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please, young lady, come under my bow!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This restoration of the words, though it probably is far
from complete, and does not make so good a game rhyme as
the reduced versions, nevertheless shows clearly enough that
the incidents belong to a ceremonial of primitive well-worship.
The pulling of the hands backwards and forwards may be
taken to indicate the raising of water from a well. If this is
conceded, the incidents might be grouped as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_108" id="PageI_108">[108]</a></span><span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li>(1.) Drawing of water from a well.</li>
<li>(2.) For a devotee at the well.</li>
<li>(3.) Collecting flowers for dressing the well.</li>
<li>(4.) Making of a cake for presentation.</li>
<li>(5.) Gifts to the well [the silver pin, gold ring, and probably the garter].</li>
<li>(6.) Command of silence.</li>
<li>(7.) The presence of the devotee at the sacred bush.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these are incidents of primitive well-worship (see
Gomme&#8217;s <i>Ethnology and Folk-lore</i>, pp. 82-103). Garland
dressing is very general; cakes were eaten at Rorrington well,
Shropshire (Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 433); pins and
portions of the dress are very general offerings; silence is
strictly enforced in many instances, and a sacred tree or bush
is very frequently found near the well.</p>

<p>The tune of the Hampshire game (Miss Mendham&#8217;s version)
is practically the same as that of the &#8220;<a href="#GameI_429">Mulberry Bush</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Newell (<i>Games of American Children</i>, p. 90) gives a version
of this game.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_27">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_197" id="GameI_197"></a>Drawing Dun out of the Mire</h3>

<p>Brand, quoting from &#8220;an old collection of satires, epigrams,
&amp;c.,&#8221; says this game is enumerated among other pastimes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At shove-groat, venter-point, or crosse and pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At leaping o&#8217;er a Midsummer bone-fier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at <i>the drawing Dun out of the myer</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So in the <i>Dutchesse of Suffolke</i>, 1631:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well done, my masters, lends your hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Draw Dun out of the ditch</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw, pull, helpe all, so, so, well done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">[<i>They pull him out.</i>]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They had shoved Bishop Bonner into a well, and were pulling
him out.</p>

<p>We find this game noticed at least as early as Chaucer&#8217;s
time, in the <i>Manciple&#8217;s Prologue</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then gan our hoste to jape and to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sayd, sires, what? <i>Dun is in the mire.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nares (<i>Glossary</i>) says this game was a rural pastime, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_109" id="PageI_109">[109]</a></span>
which <i>Dun</i> meant a dun horse, supposed to be stuck in the
mire, and sometimes represented by one of the persons who
played.</p>

<p>Gifford (<i>Ben Jonson</i>, vol. vii. p. 283), who remembered having
played at the game (doubtless in his native county, Devonshire),
thus describes it:&mdash;&#8220;A log of wood is brought into the midst
of the room: this is Dun (the cart horse), and a cry is raised
that he is stuck in the mire. Two of the company advance,
either with or without ropes, to draw him out. After repeated
attempts they find themselves unable to do it, and call for more
assistance. The game continues till all the company take part
in it, when Dun is extricated of course; and the merriment
arises from the awkward and affected efforts of the rustics to
lift the log, and sundry arch contrivances to let the ends of it
fall on one another&#8217;s toes.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_198" id="GameI_198"></a>Drop Handkerchief</h3>

<p>This is a game similar to <a href="#GameI_112">Cat and Mouse</a>, but takes its name
from the use of the handkerchief to start the pursuit. Various
rhyming formul&aelig; are used in some places. In Monton, Lancashire
(Miss Dendy), no rhyme is used.</p>

<p>The children stand in a ring. One runs round with a handkerchief
and drops it; the child behind whom it is dropped
chases the dropper, the one who gets home first takes the
vacant place, the other drops the handkerchief again.</p>

<p>In Shropshire the two players pursue one another in and out
of the ring, running under the uplifted hands of the players
who compose it: the pursuer carefully keeping on the track of
the pursued (Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 512).</p>

<p>The Dorsetshire variant is accompanied by a rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wrote a letter to my love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I carried water in my glove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the way I dropped it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dropped it, I dropped it, I dropped it, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is repeated until the handkerchief is stealthily dropped
immediately behind one of the players, who should be on the
alert to follow as quickly as possible the one who has dropped
it, who at once increases her speed and endeavours to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_110" id="PageI_110">[110]</a></span>
place left vacant by her pursuer. Should she be caught before
she can succeed in doing this she is compelled to take the
handkerchief a second time. But if, as it more usually happens,
she is successful in accomplishing this, the pursuer in
turn takes the handkerchief, and the game proceeds as before.&mdash;Symondsbury
(<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vi. 212).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jack lost his supper last night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the night before; if he does again to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never will no more&mdash;more&mdash;more&mdash;more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wrote a letter to my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the way I dropt it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of you have picked it up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And got it in your pocket&mdash;pocket&mdash;pocket&mdash;pocket.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have a little dog, it won&#8217;t bite you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It won&#8217;t bite you&mdash;it won&#8217;t bite you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It <i>will</i> bite you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;Leicestershire (Miss Ellis).</p>

<p>The Forest of Dean version is the same as the Dorsetshire,
except that the child who is unsuccessful in gaining the vacant
place has to stand in the middle of the ring until the same thing
happens to another child.&mdash;Miss Matthews.</p>

<p>In Nottinghamshire the children form in a ring; one walks
round outside the ring singing and carrying a handkerchief:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wrote a letter to my love, and on the way I dropt it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of you has picked it up and put it in your pocket.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It isn&#8217;t you, it isn&#8217;t you, &amp;c. &amp;c.; it is you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The handkerchief is then dropped at some one&#8217;s back, the
one at whose back the handkerchief was dropped chasing the
other.</p>

<p>Or they say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I lost my supper last night, I lost it the night before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I lose it again to-night, I&#8217;ll knock at somebody&#8217;s door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It isn&#8217;t you, it isn&#8217;t you, &amp;c. &amp;c.; it&#8217;s you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;Miss Winfield.</p>

<p>At Winterton and Lincoln the children form a circle, standing
arms-length apart. A child holding a handkerchief occupies the
centre of the ring and sings:</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_111" id="PageI_111">[111]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wiskit-a-waskit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A green leather basket;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrote a letter to my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the way I lost it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of you have picked it up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put it in your pocket.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a little dog at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it shan&#8217;t bite you,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(Here the singer points to each child in turn)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor you, nor you, nor you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it shall bite <i>you</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she drops the handkerchief before her chosen playmate,
who chases her in and out of the ring under the arms of the
other children until she is captured. The captor afterwards
takes the place in the centre, and the original singer becomes a
member of the circle.&mdash;Miss M. Peacock.</p>

<p>The Deptford version of the verse is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had a little dog whose name was Buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sent him up the street for a penny&#8217;orth of snuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He broke my box and spilt my snuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think my story is long enough&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tain&#8217;t you, and &#8217;tain&#8217;t you, and &#8217;tis you!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;Deptford, Kent (Miss Chase).</p>

<p>A Staffordshire and Sharleston version gives some altogether
different formul&aelig;:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">What colour&#8217;s the sky?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Look up again.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Like a W.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow me through every little hole that I go through.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;Staffordshire (Rev. G. T. Royds, Rector of Haughton).</p>

<p>At Sharleston the centre child says, &#8220;What colour is t&#8217;
sky?&#8221; The other answers, &#8220;Blue.&#8221; Centre child says,
&#8220;Follow me true.&#8221; Here the centre child runs in and out
between the others until the one who was touched catches her,
when they change places, the first joining the children in the
ring.&mdash;Sharleston (Miss Fowler).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_112" id="PageI_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>At Beddgelert, Wales (Mrs. Williams), this game is called
Tartan Boeth. It is played in precisely the same manner as the
English game, but the words used are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tartan Boeth, Oh ma&#8217;en llosgi, Boeth iawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot Tart. Oh, it burns! very hot!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the words, &#8220;Very hot!&#8221; the handkerchief is dropped.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In this game no kissing takes place, and that this is no
mere accidental omission may be shown by Mr. Udal&#8217;s description
of the Dorsetshire game. He was assured by several
persons who are interested in Dorset Children&#8217;s Games that
the indiscriminate kissing (that is, whether the girl pursued
runs little or far, or, when overtaken, whether she objects or
not) with which this game is ordinarily associated, as played
now both in Dorset and in other counties, was not indigenous
to this county, but was merely a pernicious after-growth or outcome
of later days, which had its origin in the various excursion
and holiday f&ecirc;tes, which the facilities of railway travelling had
instituted, by bringing large crowds from the neighbouring
towns into the country. He was told that thirty years ago such
a thing was unknown in the country districts of Dorset, when the
game then usually indulged in was known merely as &#8220;Drop the
Handkerchief&#8221; (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 212).</p>

<p>In other cases the rhymes are used for a purely kissing
game, for which see &#8220;<a href="#GameI_368">Kiss in the Ring</a>.&#8221;<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_8">[Addendum]</a></span> <span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_28">[Addendum]</a></span>

<p>Each child chooses a partner, and form in couples standing

couple standing at the end of the line run through the arch
just beyond the last couple standing at the top, when they
stand still and hold their handkerchief as high as possible,
which is the beginning of the second arch; this is repeated by
every last couple in succession, so that as many arches as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_113" id="PageI_113">[113]</a></span>

ludere. Is lusus est, testam teretem, jactatione fluctuum l&aelig;vigatam,
legere de litore: eam testam plano situ digitis comprehensam,
inclinem ipsum atque humilem, quantum potest, super
undas irrorare: ut illud jaculum vel dorsum maris raderet, vel

<h3><a name="GameI_204a" id="GameI_204a"></a>Duckstone</h3>

<p>A large stone called the Duckstone or Duck-table is placed
on the ground, generally with a wall for a background, but this
is of little consequence. Several boys take a stone each, and a
place pretty near the Duckstone is chosen for &#8220;home.&#8221; One
of the boys puts his stone on the Duckstone, and he is called the
Tenter. He has to guard the home and catch the other boys if
he can. Each boy in turn throws his stone at the stone on the
Duck-table and immediately runs home. The Tenter tries to
catch him before he can touch the wall or post or whatever is
chosen for the home. If the Tenter can catch him he becomes
Tenter, and puts his stone on the Duckstone, and the original
Tenter takes his turn in throwing. One rule of the game is
that the Tenter&#8217;s stone must always be on the Duck-table when
he is trying to catch a boy, so if it is knocked off it must be
replaced before he can try to catch the boy running &#8220;home.&#8221;
The chance of getting home is increased for the boy who knocks
it off.&mdash;North-West Lincolnshire (Rev. &mdash;&mdash; Roberts and Miss
Peacock).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Similar versions are from Earls Heaton (Herbert Hardy),
Ireland (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, ii. 265), Peacock (<i>Mauley and
Corringham Glossary</i>). Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) gives this
game with the following addition: If a duck falls short of
the Duckstone, and the one whose duck is on the stone
sees that he can <i>wand</i> or <i>span</i> with his hand the distance
between the duck thus thrown and the Duckstone, he shouts
out &#8220;Wands,&#8221; and if he can wand or span the distance he takes
his duck off, and the duck thus thrown is put on. Holland
(<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>), Darlington (South Cheshire), Baker
(<i>Northants Glossary</i>), and Brogden (<i>Provincial Words, Lincolnshire</i>),
also give this game. Elworthy (<i>West Somerset
Words</i>) calls it &#8220;Duck,&#8221; and &#8220;Ducks off&#8221; and &#8220;Cobbs off&#8221; in
Dorsetshire. In London the boy repeats the words, &#8220;Gully,
gully, all round the hole, one duck on,&#8221; while he is playing
(<i>Strand Magazine</i>, November 1891). Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 188)
calls it &#8220;Duck on a Rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>An undescribed game mentioned in Moor&#8217;s <i>Suffolk Words</i>,
p. 238.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_207" id="GameI_207"></a>Dumb Motions</h3>

<p>Two sides are chosen, which stand apart from each other
inside the line of their den. One side chooses a trade, and goes
to the opposite side imitating working at the trade and giving
the initial letters of it. If the opposite side guesses the name
of the trade, the players run to their own den, being chased by
their opponents. If any of the players are caught they must
go to the opposite side. In turn the opposite side chooses a
trade, and imitates the actions practised.&mdash;Cork, Ireland (Miss
Keane).</p>

<p>This is called &#8220;An Old Woman from the Wood&#8221; in Dorsetshire.
The children form themselves into two ranks.</p>

<p>The first rank says:<br />
<span class="padl11">Here comes an old &#8217;oman from the wood.</span><br />
The second party answers:<br />
<span class="padl11">What cans&#8217;t thee do?</span><br />
First Party:<span class="padl3">Do anythin&#8217;.</span><br />
Second Party: Work away.</p>

<p>This the children proceed to do, some by pretending to sew,
some to wash, some to dig, some to knit, without any instruments
to do it with. If the opposite side guess what they are
doing, they change sides. This game, Miss Summers believes,
is very old, and has been played by several generations in the
village of Hazelbury Bryan.&mdash;Dorsetshire (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>,
vii. 230).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_208" id="GameI_208"></a>Dump</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; amusement in Yorkshire, in vogue about half a
century ago, but now believed to be nearly obsolete. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_118" id="PageI_118">[118]</a></span>
played in this manner. The lads crowd round and place their
fists endways, the one on the other, till they form a high pile of
hands. Then a boy, who has one hand free, knocks the piled
fists off one by one, saying to every boy as he strikes his fist
away, &#8220;What&#8217;s there, Dump?&#8221; He continues this process till
he comes to the last fist, when he exclaims:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Every one then endeavours to refrain from speaking in spite
of mutual nudges and grimaces, and he who first allows a word
to escape is punished by the others in the various methods
adopted by schoolboys. In some places the game is played
differently. The children pile their fists in the manner described
above; then one, or sometimes all of them, sing:</p>

<p>The merriment consists in the bustle and confusion occasioned
by the rapid withdrawal of the hands (Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Nursery

<h3><a name="GameI_211" id="GameI_211"></a>Eller Tree</h3>

<p>A number of young men and women stand in a line, a tall
girl at one end of the line representing the tree. They then
begin to wrap round her, saying, &#8220;The old eller tree grows
thicker and thicker.&#8221; When they have all got round her (the
tree), they jump all together, calling out, &#8220;A bunch of rags,
a bunch of rags,&#8221; and try to tread on each other&#8217;s toes.&mdash;Sheffield,
Yorks (S. O. Addy).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo1140.png" alt="Illustration Eller Tree" width="450" height="367" />
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The tree is the alder. It abounds in the North of England
more than in any other part of the kingdom, and seems
always to have been there held in great respect and veneration.
Many superstitions also attach to the tree. It is possible from
these circumstances that the game descends from an old custom
of encircling the tree as an act of worship, and the allusion to
the &#8220;rags&#8221; bears at least a curious relationship to tree worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_120" id="PageI_120">[120]</a></span>
If this conclusion is correct, the particular form of the game
preserved by Mr. Addy may be the parent form of all games
in which the act of winding is indicated. There is more reason
for this when we consider how easy the notion of clock-winding
would creep in after the old veneration for the sacred
alder tree had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>This game is usually played in a house or schoolroom, by

other boys and girls in the room sing the lines. As they are
finished, Ezzeka, who has a bottle of water in his hand, takes
out the cork, and pours the water upon his victim&#8217;s head.

<p>A ring of chairs is formed, and the players sit on them.
A piece of string long enough to go round the inner circumference
of the chairs is procured. A small ring is put upon
the string, the ends of which are then tied. Then one of the
players gets up from his chair and stands in the centre. The
players sitting on the chairs take the string into their hands
and pass the ring round from one to another, singing the lines.
If the person standing in the centre can find out in whose hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_122" id="PageI_122">[122]</a></span>
the ring is, he sits down, and his place is taken by the one who
had the ring. The game is sometimes played round a haycock
in the hayfield.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_217" id="GameI_217"></a>Fire, Air, and Water</h3>

<p>The players seat themselves in a circle. One of the players
has a ball, to which a string is fastened. He holds the string
that he may easily draw the ball back again after it is thrown.
The possessor of the ball then throws it to one in the circle,
calling out the name of either of the elements he pleases. This
player must, before ten can be counted, give the name of an
inhabitant of that element. When &#8220;Fire&#8221; is called, strict
silence must be observed or a forfeit paid.&mdash;Cork, Ireland
(Miss Keane).</p>

<p>The players were seated in a half-circle, and the possessor
of the ball faced the others. There was no string attached
to the ball, but it was necessary that it should hit the child it
was thrown to. When &#8220;Fire&#8221; was called, &#8220;Salamander&#8221; and
&#8220;Ph&oelig;nix&#8221; were allowed to be said. The third time &#8220;Fire&#8221;
was called, silence was observed, and every player bowed
the head. We called it &#8220;Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.&#8221; A forfeit
had to be paid for every mistake.&mdash;London (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>It seems probable that a survival of fire-worship is shown
by this game.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_218" id="GameI_218"></a>Fivestones</h3>

<p>This game was played by a newspaper boy at Richmond
Station for me as follows:&mdash;He had five square pieces of tile or<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_123" id="PageI_123">[123]</a></span>
stone about the size of dice. He took all five pieces in the
palm of the hand first, then threw them up and caught them on
the back of the hand, and then from the back of the hand into
the palm. Four of the stones were then thrown on the ground;
the fifth was thrown up, one stone being picked up from the
ground, and the descending fifth stone caught in the same hand;
the other three pieces were next picked up in turn. Then two
were picked up together in the same manner twice, then one,
then three, then all four at once, the fifth stone being thrown up
and caught with each movement. All five were then thrown up
and caught on the back of the hand, and then thrown from
the back and caught in the palm. When he dropped one, he
picked it up between his outstretched fingers while the other
stones remained on the back of the hand; then he tossed and
caught it likewise. Then after throwing up the five stones and
catching them on the back of the hand and the reverse, all five
being kept in the palm, one was thrown up, and another deposited
on the ground before the descending stone was caught.
This was done to the three others in turn. Then with two at a
time twice, then one and three, then all four together, then from
the palm to the back of the hand, and again to the palm. This
completed one game. If mistakes were made another player
took the stones. Marks were taken for successful play. This
boy called the game &#8220;Dabs.&#8221;&mdash;A. B. Gomme.</p>

<p>In South Notts this game was called &#8220;Snobs.&#8221; It was
played with small stones or marbles. There were nine sets of
tricks. First One-ers (of which there were five in the set),
then Two-ers (two in set), Three-ers (three in set), Four-ers
(four in set), Four Squares (four in set), Trotting Donkeys
(eight in set, I believe), Fly-catchers (six or seven in set), Magic
(five in set), and Magic Fly-catchers (five in set). One-ers
is played thus:&mdash;The five stones are thrown into the air
and caught on the back of the hand. If all are caught they
are simply tossed up again and caught in the hollow of the
hand, but if any are not caught they have to be picked up,
one by one, another stone being at the same time thrown into
the air and caught with the one picked up in the hand.
Two-ers, Three-ers, and Four-ers, are played in the same way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_124" id="PageI_124">[124]</a></span>
except that the stones not caught on the back of the hand have
to be arranged in twos, threes, and fours respectively by the
hand on which the caught stones are lying meanwhile, and
then each lot has to be picked up altogether. If the number
that fall when the stones are first thrown up won&#8217;t allow of
this, the player has to drop the required number (but no more)
from his hand. In Magic the play is just the same as in
One-ers, except that instead of only throwing up a single
stone and catching it as the others are in turn picked up, the
whole number, except those remaining to be picked up, are
thrown and caught. In Four Squares, four of the stones are
arranged in a square, each of them is then picked up, whilst the
remaining stone is flung upwards and caught; the one picked up
is then tossed up, and the one originally tossed up is put down
in the place of the other, which is caught as it descends, and the
process repeated &#8220;all round the square.&#8221; Trotting Donkeys is
similarly played, except that the four stones are arranged in a
line&mdash;not in a square&mdash;and I believe there is some other slight
difference, but I forget what. Fly-catchers is played like
One-ers, except that the stone thrown into the air while the
others are being picked up, is not simply caught by being
allowed to fall into the hand, but by an outward movement of
the hand is <i>pounced on</i>, hawk-fashion, from above. Magic Fly-catchers
is played in precisely the same way, except that as
in simple Magic, not one stone, but all are thrown up and
caught&mdash;that is, if there are four on the ground one only is
thrown up for the first, two for the second, three for the third,
and so on until they are all picked up. This is, of course, the
most difficult part of all, and, in fact, only experts were expected
to do it. Every failure means &#8220;out,&#8221; and then your opponent
has his turn. The winner is the one who gets through first.
Such is the game as I remember it, but I have an uneasy
suspicion that I have missed something out. I seem to remember
one trick in which all the stones on the ground had to
be picked up at once <i>where they lay</i>&mdash;scrambled up so to speak.
Or it may be (and, in fact, I think it was) that sometimes, to
add to the difficulty of the game, we picked up the groups of
two, three, and four in Two-ers, Three-ers, and Four-ers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_125" id="PageI_125">[125]</a></span>
this fashion, instead of first placing them together.&mdash;Epworth,
Doncaster (C. C. Bell).</p>

<p>In Wakefield the set of pot checks, which represents five
hucklebones, now consists of four checks and a ball about the
size of a large marble. The checks are something like dice,
but only two opposite sides are plain, the other four being
fluted. The table played on is generally a doorstep, and it is
made ready by drawing a ring upon it with anything handy
which will make a mark. There are twelve figures or movements
to be gone through as follows. Some have special
names, but I do not learn that all have.</p>

<p>1. The player, taking the checks and ball in the right hand,
throws down the checks, keeping the ball in the hand. If any
check fall outside the ring the player is &#8220;down.&#8221; There is
skill needed in the throwing of the checks in this and the
following movements, so that they may be conveniently placed
for taking up in the proper order. The checks being scattered,
the player throws up the ball, takes up one check, and catches
the ball as it comes down, or, as it is sometimes played, after
it has bounced once from the step. This is repeated till all the
checks are taken up.</p>

<p>2. As the last figure, but the checks are taken up two at a
throw.</p>

<p>3. As the last, but at the first throw one check, called the
Horse, is taken up, and at the second the remaining three
checks at once, called the Cart.</p>

<p>4. As before, but all the checks taken up together.</p>

<p>5. Called Ups and Downs. The checks are taken up at one
throw, and set down outside the ring at the next. This is
done first with one, then with two, and so on.</p>

<p>6. Each check is touched in turn as the ball is thrown.</p>

<p>7. The checks are separately pushed out of the ring.</p>

<p>8. Each check in turn is taken up and knocked against the
ground.</p>

<p>9. Each check is taken up and tapped upon another.</p>

<p>10. The checks are first arranged three in a line, touching
each other, and the fourth placed at the top of that at one end
of the row. This is called the Cradle. It has to be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_126" id="PageI_126">[126]</a></span>
down check by check, and if, in taking one, another is moved,
the player is out.</p>

<p>11. Like the last, but the checks are put one above another
to make a Chimney.</p>

<p>12. Called the Dish-clout&mdash;I know not why, unless it be
that it wipes up the game. The movement used in taking up
the checks is thus described:&mdash;&#8220;Take hold of the sleeve of the
right hand with the left; throw up the ball, and twist your
right hand underneath and over your left, and catch the ball.
With the hand still twisted throw up the ball and untwist and
catch it.&#8221; The checks are picked up in the course of the
twisting.</p>

<p>These I am told are the orthodox movements; and I do not
doubt that in them there is much of very old tradition, although
the tenth and eleventh must have been either added or modified
since pot checks came into use, for the figures could not be
built up with the natural bones. Some other movements are
sometimes used according to fancy, as for example the clapping
of the ground with the palm of the hand before taking up the
checks and catching the ball.&mdash;J. T. Micklethwaite (<i>Arch. Journ.</i>,
xlix. 327-28).</p>

<p>I am told that in the iron districts of Staffordshire, the round
bits of iron punched out in making rivet holes in boiler plates
are the modern representatives of hucklebones.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>In Westminster four stones are held in the right hand, a
marble is thrown up, and all four stones thrown down, and the
marble allowed to bounce on the hearthstone or pavement, and
then caught in the same hand after it has rebounded. The
marble is then thrown up again, and one of the four stones
picked up, and the marble caught again after it has rebounded.
This is done separately to the other three, bringing all four
stones into the hand. The marble is again bounced, and all
four stones thrown down and the marble caught. Two stones
are then picked up together, then the other two, then one, then
three together, then all four together, the marble being tossed
and caught with each throw. An arch is then formed by
placing the left hand on the ground, and the four stones are
again thrown down, the marble tossed, and the four stones put<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_127" id="PageI_127">[127]</a></span>
separately into the arch, the marble being caught after it has
rebounded each time; or the four stones are separately put
between the fingers of the left hand in as straight a row as
possible. Then the left hand is taken away, and the four
stones caught up in one sweep of the hand. Then all four
stones are thrown down, and one is picked up before the marble
is caught. This is retained in the hand, and when the second
stone is picked up the first one is laid down before the marble
is caught; the third is picked up and the second laid down, the
fourth picked up and the third laid down, then the fourth laid
down, the marble being tossed and caught again each time.
The stones have different names or marks (which follow in
rotation), and in picking them up they must be taken in their
proper order, or it is counted as a mistake. The game is played
throughout by the right hand, the left hand only being used when
&#8220;arches&#8221; is made. The marble should be thrown up about the
same height each toss, and there should be little or no interval
between the different figures.&mdash;Annie Dicker.</p>

<p>I saw this game played in Endell Street, London, W.C., by
two girls. Their game was not so long nor so complete as the
above. They did not throw all four stones down as a preliminary
stage, but began with the second figure, the four gobs
being placed in a square <span class="symb">&#8759;</span>, nor were they particular as to
which stones they picked up. They knew nothing of numbering
or naming them. Their marble was called a &#8220;jack.&#8221; They
had places chalked on the pavement where they recorded their
successful &#8220;goes,&#8221; and the game was played in a ring.&mdash;A. B.
Gomme.</p>

<p>An account sent me from Deptford (Miss Chase) is doubtless
the same game. It begins with taking two &#8220;gobs&#8221; at once,
and apparently there are eight stones or gobs to play with.
The marble or round stone which is thrown up is called a
&#8220;tally.&#8221; The directions for playing are<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

This was described by the player as &#8220;while the tally is up to
sweep the whole row or line off the ground into the arch of
the finger and thumb before catching the tally.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) These games are variants of one common original. It
is the same game as that described by F. H. Low in the
<i>Strand Magazine</i>, ii. 514, as played in the London streets.
The marble there is called a &#8220;buck.&#8221; &#8220;Pegsy&#8221; was the name
of the No. 5 stage of the Wakefield version, and this varies too,
inasmuch as it was the same gob which is picked up and then
laid down before catching the buck.</p>

<p>Mr. Kinahan says, &#8220;&#8216;<a href="#GameI_336">Jackstones</a>,&#8217; played with three or four
small stones that are thrown up in the air and caught again,
seems to have been a very ancient game, as the stones have
been found in the <i>crannogs</i> or lake-dwellings in some hole near
the fireplaces, similar to where they are found in a cabin at
the present day. An old woman, or other player, at the present
time puts them in a place near the hob when they stop their
game and go to do something else&#8221; (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, ii. 266).
In the Gr&aelig;co-Roman saloon, British Museum, is a statue
originally composed of two boys quarrelling at the game of
&#8220;Tali&#8221; (see <i>Townley Gallery</i>, i. 305; Smith&#8217;s <i>Dict. Greek and
Roman Antiq.</i>, s.v. <i>Talus</i>), and it is interesting to note that
in the Deptford game the marble is called a &#8220;Tally.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Kinahan&#8217;s note suggests that &#8220;Fivestones&#8221; may be an
independent game, instead of a derivative from &#8220;<a href="#GameI_320">Hucklebones</a>.&#8221;
If this is so, we have interesting evidence of the spread or
transmission of one game from at least two centres. Professor
Attwell, in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 8th ser., iv. 201, suggests that
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_320">Hucklebones</a>&#8221; was introduced into Europe by the Romans,
and was spread throughout the countries which formed the
empire by means of Roman colonists and soldiers. Mr. Newell
(<i>Games</i>, pp. 190-93) describes a similar game to &#8220;Fivestones&#8221;
played in Boston under the name of &#8220;Otadama,&#8221; or &#8220;Japanese
Jacks.&#8221; This game is of Japanese origin, &#8220;Tedama&#8221; (that
is, &#8220;Handballs&#8221;) being its proper name. He says there can
be no doubt that the two forms of this amusement are branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_129" id="PageI_129">[129]</a></span>
of the same root; and we thus have an example of a game
which, having preserved its essential characteristics for thousands
of years, has fairly circumnavigated the globe, so that
the two currents of tradition, westward and eastward, from
Europe and Asia, have met in America.</p>

<p>Sides are chosen; each side must have a &#8220;home&#8221; at the top
and bottom of the ground where the children are playing. One
side chooses a flower and goes over to the other side, the
members of which stand in a row facing the first side. The
first side states the initial letters of the flower it has chosen,
and when the second side guesses the right flower they run
and try to catch as many of the opposite side as they can
before they reach their home. The captives then become

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the <a href="#GableEHeaton">Yorkshire version</a> a ring is formed with one child in
the middle as the &#8217;Oary Man. Whatever he, or she, does, all in
the ring must mimic, going round and singing at the same time.
Any one found late in changing the action or idle in obeying
the caperings of the central child becomes the &#8217;Oary Man in
place of the child taking that part. Both girls and boys play.
In the <a href="#GableRedhill">Redhill version</a>, Holy Gabriel kneels in the middle of
the circle. He acts as leader, and always had the fiddle as his
instrument, though he now usually plays the pianoforte as his
first instrument. The other children choose any instrument
they like. Holy Gabriel pretends to play the fiddle, and all
the other children play their own instruments until Holy
Gabriel changes his to one of theirs, when that one must
immediately begin to play the fiddle, and continue until Holy
Gabriel takes another instrument or returns to the fiddle.
This is done in vigorous pantomime. In the <a href="#GableLuton">Luton variant</a> the
children sit in a semicircle, the Drummer faces them. He
plays the drum; all the other children play on any other instrument
they like. If the other players do not at once change
their instrument, or neglect to sing the lines, a forfeit is
demanded.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_131" id="PageI_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Mr. Hardy says some sing this game, &#8220;Follow my game
an holy man.&#8221; Mr. Hardy once thought it was the remnant
of a goblin story of a hoary man of the gable or house-roof,
who presided over the destinies of poor cottagers, and he
had begun to make out the folk tale. The fairy would sometimes
come down, and, playing his antics, compel whomsoever
observed him to follow him in a mimicking procession. Miss
Hope writes of &#8220;Holy Gabriel&#8221; that the game is played at
Mead Vale, a small village in Surrey, but is unknown at larger
villages and towns a few miles off. Some of the women who
played it in their youth say that it began in the Primitive
Methodist school at Mead Vale. It is played at Outword, also
a remote village, and was introduced there by a stonemason,
who stated that he had learned it from a cousin who had been
in America. Further inquiry by Miss Hope elicited the fact
that the cousin had learned the game, when a boy, in his native
place in Lancashire. He did not know whether it was a well-known
game there. This information points perhaps to a
modern origin, but in such cases it must be borne in mind that
people are very fond of suggesting recent circumstances as the
cause of the most ancient traditions or customs. The obvious
analogy to the incident in the myth of the Pied Piper, and to
the Welsh custom at St. Almedha Church, near Brecknock,
recorded by Giraldus Cambrensis, where the imitation of a
frenzied leader is carried out as a religious ceremony, rather
suggests that in this game we may have a survival of a ceremonial
so common among early or uncultured people, the chief
incident of which is the frenzied dancing of a god-possessed
devotee.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_221" id="GameI_221"></a>Follow my Leader</h3>

<p>This is a boys&#8217; game. Any number can take part in it. It
requires a good extent of country to play it well. The boy who
is the swiftest runner and the best jumper is chosen as Leader.
He sets out at a good speed over the fields, tries to jump as
many ditches or burns, jumping such from one side to the
other again and again, to scramble over dykes, through hedges,
over palings, and run up braes. The others have to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_132" id="PageI_132">[132]</a></span>
him as they can. This steeplechase continues till the followers
are all tired out.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>This is a very general game among schoolboys, but in Hereford
it was a town custom occurring once in seven years on
11th October (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 75).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_222" id="GameI_222"></a>Fool, Fool, come to School</h3>

<p>This game is played under the name of &#8220;Foolie, Foolie&#8221; at
Duthil, Strathspey. The players are placed in a row, either
standing or sitting. Two are chosen, the one as Namer and
the other as Foolie. Foolie withdraws, if not out of sight, at
least out of range of hearing. The Namer then gives a name
secretly to each player. When this is done, he calls on
Foolie&mdash;Foolie, Foolie, come to your schoolie.</p>

<p>Foolie pays no attention to this call. It is again repeated,
but with the same results. This goes on for several times.
At last the Namer calls out<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Foolie, Foolie, come to your schoolie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your bannocks are burnin&#8217; an&#8217; ready for turnin&#8217;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Foolie always obeys this call, comes and stations himself
beside the Namer. A little chaffing generally goes on against
Foolie. The Namer says, &#8220;Come chise me oot, come chise
me in, tae&#8221; so and so, naming one by the assumed fancy name.
Foolie makes choice of one. If the choice falls right, the one
so chosen steps from the line and stands beside Foolie. If the
choice falls wrong, the one named remains in the line. All the
players&#8217; names are called out in this way. If any stand unchosen
by Foolie, the Namer then goes up to each and asks if
he wants, <i>e.g.</i>, &#8220;an aipple,&#8221; &#8220;an orange,&#8221; &#8220;a kirk,&#8221; &#8220;a cottage,&#8221;
&amp;c. Each one whispers what he wants. The same question
is put to Foolie. If he answers, <i>e.g.</i>, &#8220;orange,&#8221; the one so
named steps out and stands beside Foolie. All not first chosen
are gone over in this way. Those left unchosen take their
stand beside the Namer. There is then a tug-of-war, with the
Namer and Foolie as the leaders.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>In Hants the children stand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, as in a country dance.
One of the number is sent out of earshot, and the others decide
with the Captain as to the name of the bird each wishes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_133" id="PageI_133">[133]</a></span>
personate. The Captain then calls to the child who is out,
&#8220;Tom Fool, Tom Fool, come home from school, and pick me
out a blackbird,&#8221; &#8220;cuckoo,&#8221; or other bird. If Tom Fool is
wrong in his guessing after three trials, he is condemned to
run the gauntlet, being pelted with gloves or handkerchiefs not
too mercifully.&mdash;Bitterne, Hants (Miss Byford).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_223" id="GameI_223"></a>Foot and Over</h3>

<p>One boy out of a number stoops in the position for &#8220;<a href="#GameI_385">Leap-frog</a>&#8221;
at an agreed fixed line. From the players he chooses a
Leader and a Foot. The Leader first leaps over the stooping
boy at a foot from the line; the other players then leap in turn
each at a foot further from the line, the stooping boy moving
forward from the line for each player; finally the Foot leaps as
far as the distance leapt by the last boy. If this is accomplished,
the Leader hops from the line and then leaps; the
followers hop and leap each a foot further than each other;
finally the Foot hops and leaps as far as the distance covered
by the last boy. If this is accomplished, the Leader hops twice
and then leaps; the same process going on until one of the
boys fails, who then takes the place of the stooping boy, and
the game begins again. If the Foot covers any longer distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_134" id="PageI_134">[134]</a></span>
than the Leader, the Leader stoops down.&mdash;Earls Heaton,

<p>This game is general. Mr. Emslie describes the London
version somewhat differently. After all the boys had jumped
over the first boy&#8217;s back, a cry of &#8220;Foot it&#8221; was raised, and
the boy who had given the back placed one of his feet at a right
angle to the other, and in this way measured a &#8220;foot&#8217;s length&#8221;
from the starting-place. All the boys then &#8220;overed&#8221; his back
from the original line, the last one crying &#8220;Foot it,&#8221; and then
the measuring ceremony was again gone through, and the game
commenced again, and continued in the same manner until one
of the boys failed to &#8220;over&#8221; the back, when he became Back.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_57">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_224" id="GameI_224"></a>Football</h3>

<p>The modern game of &#8220;Football&#8221; is too well known to need
description here, and, like &#8220;<a href="#GameI_163">Cricket</a>,&#8221; it has become no longer
a children&#8217;s game. As to its origin, there are many ball games,
such as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_99">Camping</a>,&#8221; which have been suggested as the original
form of &#8220;Football.&#8221; Every school almost had some peculiarity
in the method of playing, and Eton, Winchester, Uppingham,
and Rugby are well-known examples. It is not a little interesting
to note, now that &#8220;Football&#8221; has settled down into a
national game organised by county committees, that one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_135" id="PageI_135">[135]</a></span>
forms of play officially recognised is the old Rugby game, the
other form, known as the &#8220;Association,&#8221; being arrived at by
agreement of those interested in the game.</p>

<p>To illustrate the ancient origin of the game, and its serious
import as a local contest rather than a sport, some examples may
be given. It is still (1877) keenly contested at Workington on
Easter Tuesday on the banks of, and not unfrequently in, the river
Derwent (Dickinson&#8217;s <i>Cumberland Glossary</i>). At Derby there
was a football contest between the parishes of All Saints&#8217; and
St. Peter&#8217;s. The ball was thrown into the market-place from
the Town Hall. The moment it was thrown the &#8220;war cries&#8221;
of the rival parishes began, and the contest, nominally that of
a football match, was in reality a fight between the two sections
of the town; and the victors were announced by the joyful
ringing of their parish bells (Dyer&#8217;s <i>Popular Customs</i>, p. 75).
At Chester-le-Street the game was played between what were
termed &#8220;up-streeters&#8221; and &#8220;down-streeters,&#8221; one side endeavouring
to get the ball to the top of the town, whilst their
opponents tried to keep it near the lower or north end. At one
o&#8217;clock the ball was thrown out from near the old commercial
hotel, the Queen&#8217;s Head, in the centre of the town, and it has
often been received by over three and four hundred people, so
great was the interest taken in this ancient sport. At Asborne
the struggle was between the &#8220;up&#8217;ards&#8221; and &#8220;down&#8217;ards.&#8221; At
Dorking the divisions were between the east and west ends of
the town, and there was first a perambulation of the streets by
the football retinue composed of grotesquely dressed persons.
At Alnwick the divisions were the parishes of St. Michael&#8217;s and
St. Paul&#8217;s. At Kirkwall the contest was on New Year&#8217;s Day,
and was between &#8220;up the gates&#8221; and &#8220;down the gates,&#8221; the ball
being thrown up at the Cross. At Scarborough, on the morning
of Shrove Tuesday, hawkers paraded the streets with parti-coloured
balls, which were purchased by all ranks of the community.
With these, and armed with sticks, men, women, and
children repaired to the sands below the old town and indiscriminately
commenced a contest. The following graphic
account of Welsh customs was printed in the <i>Oswestry Observer</i>
of March 2, 1887: &#8220;In South Cardiganshire it seems that about<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_136" id="PageI_136">[136]</a></span>
eighty years ago the population, rich and poor, male and female,
of opposing parishes, turned out on Christmas Day and indulged
in the game of &#8216;Football&#8217; with such vigour that it became little
short of a serious fight. The parishioners of Cellan and Pencarreg
were particularly bitter in their conflicts; men threw
off their coats and waistcoats and women their gowns, and
sometimes their petticoats. At Llanwenog, an extensive parish
below Lampeter, the inhabitants for football purposes were
divided into the Bros and the Blaenaus. A man over eighty, an
inmate of Lampeter Workhouse, gives the following particulars:&mdash;In
North Wales the ball was called the B&ecirc;l Troed, and
was made with a bladder covered with a Cwd Tarw. In South
Wales it was called B&eacute;l Ddu, and was usually made by the shoe-maker
of the parish, who appeared on the ground on Christmas
Day with the ball under his arm. The Bros, it should be stated,
occupied the high ground of the parish. They were nicknamed
&#8216;Paddy Bros,&#8217; from a tradition that they were descendants from
Irish people who settled on the hills in days long gone by.
The Blaenaus occupied the lowlands, and, it may be presumed,
were pure-bred Brythons. The more devout of the Bros and
Blaenaus joined in the service at the parish church on Christmas
morning. At any rate, the match did not begin until about
mid-day, when the service was finished. Then the whole of
the Bros and Blaenaus, rich and poor, male and female,
assembled on the turnpike road which divided the highlands
from the lowlands. The ball having been redeemed from the
Crydd, it was thrown high in the air by a strong man, and
when it fell Bros and Blaenaus scrambled for its possession,
and a quarter of an hour frequently elapsed before the ball was
got out from among the struggling heap of human beings.
Then if the Bros, by hook or by crook, could succeed in taking
the ball up the mountain to their hamlet of Rhyddlan they won
the day; while the Blaenaus were successful if they got the
ball to their end of the parish at New Court. The whole
parish was the field of operations, and sometimes it would be
dark before either party scored a victory. In the meantime
many kicks would be given and taken, so that on the following
day some of the competitors would be unable to walk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_137" id="PageI_137">[137]</a></span>
sometimes a kick on the shins would lead the two men concerned
to abandon the game until they had decided which was
the better pugilist. There do not appear to have been any
rules for the regulation of the game; and the art of football
playing in the olden time seems to have been to reach the goal.
When once the goal was reached, the victory was celebrated by
loud hurrahs and the firing of guns, and was not disturbed until
the following Christmas Day. Victory on Christmas Day, added
the old man, was so highly esteemed by the whole countryside,
that a Bro or Blaenau would as soon lose a cow from his
cow-house as the football from his portion of the parish.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In Gomme&#8217;s <i>Village Community</i>, pp. 241-44, the position
of football games as elements in the traditions of race is discussed,
and their relationship to a still earlier form of tribal
games, where the element of clan feuds is more decidedly preserved,
is pointed out.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_225" id="GameI_225"></a>Forfeits</h3>

<p>Forfeits are incurred in those games in which penalties are
exacted from players for non-compliance with the rules of the
game; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_84">Buff</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_156">Contrary</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_167">Crosspurposes</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_217">Fire, Air, and

under their several titles, and the formula for forfeits is always
the same. Small articles belonging to the players must be
given by them every time a forfeit is incurred, and these
must be redeemed at the close of the game. They are &#8220;cried&#8221;
in the following manner:&mdash;One of the players sits on a chair
having the forfeits in her lap. A child kneels on the ground
and buries his face in his hands on the lap of the person who
holds the forfeits. The &#8220;crier&#8221; then takes up indiscriminately
one of the forfeits, and holding it up in the sight of all those
who have been playing the games (without the kneeling child
seeing it), says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here&#8217;s a very pretty thing and a very pretty thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what shall be done to [<i>or</i>, by] the owner of this very pretty thing?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_138" id="PageI_138">[138]</a></span>The kneeling child then says what the penance is to be.
The owner of the forfeit must then perform the penance before
the other players, and then another forfeit is &#8220;cried.&#8221;</p>

<p>The more general penances imposed upon the owners of the
forfeits are as follows, but the list could be very much extended:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li>Bite an inch off the poker.</li>
<li>Kneel to the prettiest, bow to the wittiest, and kiss the one you love best.</li>
<li>Stand in each corner of the room, sigh in one, cry in another, sing in another, and dance in the other.</li>
<li>Put yourself through the keyhole.</li>
<li>Place two chairs in the middle of the room, take off your shoes, and jump over them.</li>
<li>Measure so many yards of love ribbon.</li>

<p>Miss Burne mentions one penance designed to make the
victim ridiculous, as when he is made to lie on his back on the
floor with his arms extended, and declare<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="source">&mdash;<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, pp. 526-27.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Halliwell gives, in his <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, pp. 324-26,
some curious verses, recorded for the first time by Dr. Kenrick
in his Review of Dr. Johnson&#8217;s Shakespeare, 1765, on &#8220;rules
for seemly behaviour,&#8221; in which the forfeits imposed by barbers
as penalties for handling razors, &amp;c., are set forth. Although
&#8220;barbers&#8217; forfeits&#8221; are not of the same nature as the nursery
forfeits, it is possible that this general custom among so important
a class of the community in early times as barbers may
have suggested the game. Both Forby in his <i>Vocabulary of
East Anglia</i> and Moor in his <i>Suffolk Words</i> bear testimony
to the general prevalence of barbers&#8217; forfeits, and it must be
borne in mind that barbers were also surgeons in early days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_139" id="PageI_139">[139]</a></span>
A curious custom is also recorded in another East Anglian
word-list, which may throw light upon the origin of the game
from popular custom. &#8220;A forfeit is incurred by using the
word &#8216;water&#8217; in a brew-house, where you must say &#8216;liquor;&#8217;
or by using the word &#8216;grease&#8217; in a chandlery, where it is &#8217;stuff&#8217;
or &#8216;metal.&#8217; The forfeit is to propitiate the offended <i>genius
loci</i>&#8221; (Spurden&#8217;s <i>East Anglian Vocabulary</i>). The element of
divination in the custom is perhaps indicated by a curious note
from Waldron, in his <i>Description of the Isle of Man</i> (<i>Works</i>,
p. 55), &#8220;There is not a barn unoccupied the whole twelve
days, every parish hiring fiddlers at the public charge. On
Twelfth Day the fiddler lays his head on some of the wenches&#8217;
laps, and a third person asks who such a maid or such a maid
shall marry, naming the girls then present one after another;
to which he answers according to his own whim, or agreeable
to the intimacies he has taken notice of during this time of
merriment. But whatever he says is as absolutely depended
on as an oracle; and if he happen to couple two people who
have an aversion to each other, tears and vexation succeed the
mirth. This they call cutting off the fiddler&#8217;s head; for after
this he is dead for the whole year.&#8221; Redeeming the forfeits is
called &#8220;Crying the Weds,&#8221; in Burne&#8217;s <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>,
p. 526. See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_254">Wadds</a>.&#8221;<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_10">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Halliwell gives this rhyme as No. ccclvii. of his <i>Nursery
Rhymes</i>, but without any description of the game beyond the
words, &#8220;A game of the fox.&#8221; It is probably the same game as
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_227">Fox and Goose</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_227" id="GameI_227"></a>Fox and Goose (1)</h3>

<p>In Dorsetshire one of the party, called the Fox, takes one
end of the room or corner of a field (for the game was equally
played indoors or out); all the rest of the children arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_140" id="PageI_140">[140]</a></span>
themselves in a line or string, according to size, one behind the
other, the smallest last, behind the tallest one, called Mother
Goose, with their arms securely round the waist of the one in
front of them, or sometimes by grasping the dress.</p>

<p>The game commences by a parley between the Fox and
Goose to this effect, the Goose beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you after this fine morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With what object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To get an appetite for a meal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does [will] your meal consist of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice fat goose for my breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where will you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall get a nice morsel somewhere; and as they are
so handy, I shall satisfy myself with one of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch one if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lively scene follows. The Fox and Mother Goose should
be pretty evenly matched; the Mother with extended arms
seeking to protect her Brood, while the Fox, who tries to dodge
under, right and left, is only allowed in case of a successful
foray or grasp to secure the last of the train. Vigorous efforts
are made to escape him, the Brood of course supplementing
the Mother&#8217;s exertions to elude him as far as they are able,
but without breaking the link. The game may be continued
until all in turn are caught.&mdash;<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 217-18.</p>

<p>In Lancashire the children stand in line behind each other,
holding each other by the waist. One stands facing them and
calls out<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My mother sits on yonder chimney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she says she <i>must</i> have a chicken.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The others answer<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She <i>can&#8217;t</i> have a chicken.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The one then endeavours to catch the last child of the tail,
who when caught comes behind the captor; repeat until all
have changed sides.&mdash;Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy).</p>

<p>A version of this game played at Eckington, Derbyshire,
is played as follows:&mdash;A den is chalked out or marked out for
the Fox. A larger den, opposite to this, is marked out for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_141" id="PageI_141">[141]</a></span>
Geese. A boy or a girl represents the Fox, and a number
of others the Geese. Then the Fox shouts, &#8220;Geese, Geese,
gannio,&#8221; and the Geese answer, &#8220;Fox, Fox, fannio.&#8221; Then
the Fox says, &#8220;How many Geese have you to-day?&#8221; The
Geese reply, &#8220;More than you can catch and carry away.&#8221;
Then the Geese run out of the den, and the Fox tries to catch
them. He puts as many as he catches into his den (S. O.
Addy).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game is a very general one at Christmas time. It
is practically the same as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_247">Gled Wylie</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#GameI_272">Hen and
Chickens</a>,&#8221; and the &#8220;Hawk and Chickens&#8221; of Mr. Newell&#8217;s
<i>Games and Songs of American Children</i>, pp. 155-56. By
referring to these games it will be seen that the whole group are
mimic representatives of farmyard episodes, though the animal
characters are giving way to more domestic affairs, as shown
in the Pins and Needles version of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_272">Hen and Chickens</a>.&#8221;
It is possible that the different animals which are victims to
the Fox appearing in the different games may arise from local
circumstances, and that in this case a real distinction exists
between the various names by which this game is known.
A game called &#8220;Wolf and Deer,&#8221; similar to &#8220;Fox and Geese,&#8221;
is given in <i>Winter Evening Amusements</i>, by R. Revel. The
last one at the end of the tail may, if she has no other chance
of escape, try and place herself before the Deer or Hen. She
is then no longer to be hunted; all the others must then follow
her example until the deer becomes the last of the line. The
game then terminates by exacting a forfeit for each lady whom
the Wolf has suffered to escape his clutches (pp. 64, 65).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_228" id="GameI_228"></a>Fox and Geese (2)</h3>

<p>A game known by this name is played with marbles or pegs
on a board on which are thirty-three holes, or on the pavement,
with holes scraped out of the stones. To play this game
there are seventeen pieces called Geese, and another one either
larger or distinguished from the Geese by its colour, which is
called the Fox. The Fox occupies the centre hole, and the
Geese occupy nine holes in front, and four on each side of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_142" id="PageI_142">[142]</a></span>
The vacant holes behind are for the Geese and Fox to move in.
The game is for the Geese to shut up the Fox so that he cannot
move. All the pieces can be moved from one spot to another
in the direction of the lines, but cannot pass over two holes at
once. The Geese are not permitted to take the Fox. The
Fox&#8217;s business is to take all, or as many of the Geese as will
prevent him from being blockaded. The Fox can take the
Geese whenever there is a vacant space behind them, which he
passes to, then occupies.</p>

<p>This game has been very popular among schoolboys in all ages.
Mr. Micklethwaite, in a paper on the Indoor Games of School
Boys in the Middle Ages (<i>Arch. Journ.</i> xlix. 322), gives instances
of finding figures of this game cut &#8220;in the cloister benches
of Gloucester Cathedral and elsewhere, and there are several on
the twelfth century tomb at Salisbury, miscalled Lord Stourton&#8217;s,&#8221;
and also at Norwich Castle. For the date of these boards,
Mr. Micklethwaite says for the last three centuries and a half
cloisters everywhere in England have been open passages, and
there have generally been schoolboys about. It is therefore
not unlikely that they should have left behind them such traces
as these play-boards. But if they are of later date they would
not be found to be distributed in monastic cloisters with respect
to the monastic arrangement, and we do find them so. Strutt
describes the game (<i>Sports</i>, p. 319).</p>

<p>See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_439">Nine Men&#8217;s Morris</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_443">Noughts and Crosses</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_229" id="GameI_229"></a>Fox in the Fold</h3>

<p>&#8220;The Tod (Fox) i&#8217; the Faul (Fold).&#8221; This game is commonly
played by boys. Any number of boys join hands and stand
in a circle to form the Faul. The boy that represents the Tod
is placed within the circle. His aim is to escape. To effect
this he rushes with all his force, increased by a run, against
the joint hands of any two of the players. If the rush does
not unloose the grasp, he hangs on the two arms with all his
weight, pressing and wriggling. If he fails he makes a rush at
another two, always selecting those players he thinks weakest.
When he does break through he rushes off at the top of his
speed, with all the players in full cry, till he is caught and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_143" id="PageI_143">[143]</a></span>
brought back. The game begins anew with another boy as
Tod.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_86">Bull in the Park</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_237">Frog in the Middle</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_230" id="GameI_230"></a>Fox in the Hole</h3>

<p>All the players are armed with handkerchiefs. One of the
players is chosen for Fox, who has his den marked out. The
Fox hops out on one leg, with his handkerchief ready to strike.
The players gather round him and attack him. If he can
strike one of his assailants without putting his foot to the
ground from his hopping position, the player so struck is
chased by the others into the den, and he then becomes the
Fox for another round of the game.&mdash;Cork (Miss Keane).</p>

<p>Halliwell (<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, p. 228) describes the game in
practically the same manner, but adds that when the Fox is
coming out he says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Fox gives warning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It&#8217;s a cold and frosty morning,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>after which he is at liberty to hop out and use his handkerchief.</p>

<p><i>(b)</i> This game is alluded to in <i>Soliman and Perseda</i>, 1599;
<i>Florio</i>, p. 480; <i>Herrick</i>, i. 176. See Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.
Professor Mayor communicated to the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>
of 1848 (ii.), p. 147, the following early allusions to the game
from old dictionaries:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

the hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>A similar game to this is played at Earls Heaton, Yorkshire
(Mr. Hardy), and called &#8220;Goose and Gander.&#8221; Two players,
the Goose and the Gander, stand in a ring, each on one leg.
They hop out in turn, and try to catch one of the other players
without letting their other leg touch the ground. If they fail
in this they get &#8220;strapped&#8221; back to the ring. When either
are successful, the player who is caught takes the place of
either Goose or Gander in turn. The game is also mentioned
in <i>Useful Transactions in Philosophy</i>, 1708-9.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_231" id="GameI_231"></a>French Jackie</h3>

<p>This game is played either by boys or girls or by both
together. One is chosen to stand alone; the other players
join hands and form a circle. The one outside the circle goes
round it and touches on the back one of the circle. He then
runs off round the circle, and the one who was touched runs
off in the opposite direction round the circle. The aim of each
player is to reach the vacant place in the circle first. The one
left out has to repeat the same action. The game may go on
for any length of time.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>At Barnes this game is called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_238">Gap</a>.&#8221; It is known as
&#8220;French Tag&#8221; in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire (Miss
Matthews), and &#8220;Tap-back&#8221; at Bitterne, Hants (Mrs. Adam).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_232" id="GameI_232"></a>French and English</h3>

<p>The children choose sides under a leader, and a boundary
line is made in the middle of the ground dividing the French
and English territory. A handkerchief is then placed in the
back part of each territory to represent a flag. The object is
to obtain as many flags from the opposite side as possible. If
a person is captured before having seized a flag, he is taken
prisoner, and must be rescued by one of his own side. Thus,
for instance, an Englishman enters the French territory and
tries to reach the flag. If he is seen by the French before he
reaches the flag, he is taken prisoner and is placed near the
flags, and the next Englishman rescues him instead of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_145" id="PageI_145">[145]</a></span>
a flag. As soon as the flag is taken, one of the party must
put another handkerchief in its place. A player cannot be
taken prisoner after having obtained the handkerchief or flag.
The winning side is decided by counting the flags and prisoners.&mdash;Bitterne,
Hants (Mrs. Byford).</p>

<p>This is a very general game, and is known as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_129">Scotch and

<p>A game played between the dances at balls in farm-houses.
A chair was placed in the middle of the barn or room; the
master of the ceremonies led to the chair a young woman, who
sat down and named the young man whom she was willing
should kiss her. This he did, and then took the seat which
the lady vacated. He then called out the name of some
favourite girl, who was led up to him; there was another kiss.
The girl then took the seat, and so on (county of Down). The
same game is called &#8220;Frimsey-framsey&#8221; in parts of the county

<h3><a name="GameI_237" id="GameI_237"></a>Frog in the Middle</h3>

<p>One child is seated on the ground with his legs under him;
the other players form a ring round. They then pull or buffet
the centre child or Frog, who tries to catch one of them without<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_146" id="PageI_146">[146]</a></span>
rising from the floor. The child who is caught takes the place
of the centre child. Another method of playing the game is
similar to &#8220;<a href="#GameI_86">Bull in the Park</a>.&#8221; The child in the centre tries to
break out of the ring, those forming it keeping the Frog in the
ring by any means in their power, while still keeping their
hands clasped. They sometimes sing or say<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hey! hey! hi! Frog in the middle and there shall lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He can&#8217;t get out and he shan&#8217;t get out&mdash;hey! hey! hi!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They dance round when saying this, all keeping a watch on the
Frog, who suddenly makes a rush, and tries to break through
the ring.&mdash;London (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_239" id="GameI_239"></a>Garden Gate</h3>

<p>Children join hands and form a ring. One child stands inside
the ring; this child walks round and asks one of the circle,
called the Keeper<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have you the key of the garden gate?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ask him and he&#8217;ll give it to you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is repeated by each one in the circle. Then the inside
child comes again to the Keeper and says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None of the neighbours have got the key,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So you must let me go through.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I&#8217;ve lost the key of the garden gate,<br /></span>

first gives way has to take the place in the centre.&mdash;Roxton,

<h3><a name="GameI_240" id="GameI_240"></a>Gegg</h3>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_151">To smuggle the Gegg</a>,&#8221; a game played by boys in Glasgow,
in which two parties are formed by lot, equal in number, the
one being denominated the Outs, the other Ins. The Outs
are those who go out from the den or goal, where those called
the Ins remain for a time. The Outs get the Gegg, which is
anything deposited, as a key, a penknife, &amp;c. Having received
this, they conceal themselves, and raise the cry, &#8220;Smugglers!&#8221;
On this they are pursued by the Ins; and if the Gegg (for the
name is transferred to the person who holds the deposit) be
taken, they exchange situations&mdash;the Outs become Ins and the
Ins Outs. This play is distinguished from &#8220;Hy-spy&#8221; only
by the use of the Gegg. One of the Ins who is touched by
one of the Outs is said to be taken, and henceforth loses his
right to hold the Gegg. If he who holds the Gegg gets
in the den, the Outs are winners, and have the privilege of
getting out again. The Outs, before leaving the den, shuffle
the Gegg, or smuggle it so between each other that the Ins
do not know which person has it. He who is laid hold of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_148" id="PageI_148">[148]</a></span>
and put to the question, is supposed to deny that he has
the Gegg: if he escapes with it, he gets out again.&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_241" id="GameI_241"></a>Genteel Lady</h3>

<p>A player begins thus:&mdash;&#8220;I, a genteel lady (or gentleman)
came from that genteel lady (or gentleman) to say that she (or
he) owned a tree.&#8221; The other players repeat the words in
turn, and then the leader goes over them again, adding, &#8220;with
bronze bark.&#8221; The sentence goes round once more, and on the
next repetition the leader continues, &#8220;with golden branches.&#8221;
He afterwards adds, &#8220;and silver leaves,&#8221; &#8220;and purple fruit,&#8221;
&#8220;and on the top a milk-white dove,&#8221; and, finally, &#8220;mourning
for the loss of his lady-love.&#8221;</p>

<p>If a player should fail in repeating the rigmarole, there is a
fine to pay. A &#8220;pipe-lighter&#8221; is stuck in her hair, and she
must say &#8220;one-horned lady&#8221; instead of &#8220;genteel lady.&#8221; When
a second horn is added, of course she says &#8220;two-horned,&#8221; and
so forth. Some players wear half-a-dozen before the conclusion
of the game. The game is called &#8220;The Wonderful Tree.&#8221;&mdash;Anderby,
Lincolnshire (Miss M. Peacock).</p>

<p>In some parts of Yorkshire it is customary to say &#8220;no-horned
lady&#8221; instead of &#8220;genteel lady&#8221; at the beginning of
the game.</p>

<p>When we played this game we said &#8220;always genteel&#8221; after
&#8220;genteel lady,&#8221; and varied the formula. For instance, the
first player would say, &#8220;I, a genteel lady, always genteel,
come from a genteel lady, always genteel, to say she lives in
a house with twelve windows,&#8221; or words were used beginning
with the letter A. Each player must repeat this, and add
something else in keeping with a house; or sentences had to
be made in which words beginning with the letter A must be
said, the other players doing the same alphabetically.&mdash;London
(A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>Mr. Newell, in writing of this game, says that the &#8220;lamp-lighter&#8221;
or &#8220;spill&#8221; was lighted when placed in the hair of the
players who made mistakes. He does not mention forfeits
being exacted.&mdash;<i>Games</i>, p. 139.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_242" id="GameI_242"></a>Ghost at the Well</h3>

<p>One of the party is chosen for Ghost (if dressed in white so
much the better); she hides in a corner; the other children
are a mother and daughters. The eldest daughter says:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, mother, please give me a piece of bread and
butter.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. &#8220;Let me (or &#8216;leave me&#8217;) look at your hands, child.
Why, they are very dirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>E. D. &#8220;I will go to the well and wash them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She goes to the corner, the Ghost peeps up, and she rushes
back, crying out<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! mother! I have seen a Ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. &#8220;Nonsense, child! it was only your father&#8217;s nightshirt I
have washed and hung out to dry. Go again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child goes, and the same thing happens. She returns,
saying<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! mother! I have seen a ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. &#8220;Nonsense, child! we will take a candle, and all go
together to search for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother picks up a twig for a candle, and they set off.
When they come near to the Ghost, she appears from her
hiding-place, mother and children rush away in different directions,
the Ghost chases them until she has caught one, who in
her turn becomes Ghost.&mdash;West Cornwall (Miss Courtney,
<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 55).</p>

<p>This game was &#8220;Ghost in the Copper&#8221; in London. It was
played in the same way as above. Chairs formed the copper,
and the ghost crouched down behind. The &#8220;Mother&#8221; was
&#8220;washing&#8221; at a tub, also formed with two chairs. The eldest
daughter was told she could not go to school to-day; she must
stop at home and help hang up the clothes. The other children
go to play. The Mother said, &#8220;Here, Jane, take this (pretending
to give her a garment out of the wash-tub) and put
it in the copper, and push it down well with the stick.&#8221; Jane
goes to the copper and pretends to take off the lid. When
she puts the washed garment in, and pokes down with the
stick, the Ghost jumps up. She cries out as above, the Mother
saying, &#8220;Nonsense, child! it&#8217;s only some of the boiling clothes.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_150" id="PageI_150">[150]</a></span>
The child goes again, and the game proceeds as above. It is
generally played now as &#8220;Ghost.&#8221;&mdash;A. B. Gomme. It is mentioned
by Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 223).<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_22">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_243" id="GameI_243"></a>Giants</h3>

<p>A Giant is chosen, and he must be provided with a cave. A
summer-house will do, if there is no window for the Giant to
see out of. The others then have to knock at the door with
their knuckles separately. The Giant rushes when he thinks
all the children have knocked, and if he succeeds in catching
one before they reach a place of safety (appointed beforehand)
the captured one becomes Giant.&mdash;Bitterne, Hants (Mrs.
Byford). See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_280">Wolf</a>.&#8221;</p>

his eyes covered by his hands, and the others hide while he is
saying the &#8220;nominy.&#8221; At the conclusion he uncovers his eyes,
and if he sees any boys not yet hidden they have to stand still.
He seeks the rest, but if he moves far away from his place,
called the &#8220;stooil&#8221; (stool), one of the hidden boys may rush
out and take it, provided he can get there first. Should he fail
in this he also has to stand aside; but if any one succeeds,
then all run out as before, and the same boy has to say the
&#8220;nominy&#8221; again. On the other hand, if he finds all the boys
without loosing his &#8220;stooil,&#8221; the boy first caught has to take
his place and say the &#8220;nominy.&#8221; The game was thus played

<p class="source">&mdash;Congleton Workhouse School (Miss A. E. Tremlow).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The popular version of this game is played by the
greater number of the children forming a line on one side with
joined hands, and one child (sometimes two or more) facing
them, advancing and retiring while singing the verses. When
he asks the question, &#8220;Will you come?&#8221; one girl on the opposite
side answers &#8220;No!&#8221; and afterwards &#8220;Yes!&#8221; When this is
said, she goes to the opposite side, and the two dance round
together while singing the next verse. The game begins again
by the two singing the verses, and thus getting a third child to
join them, when the game proceeds for a fourth, and so on.</p>

<p>The <a href="#GreenGrassCongleton">Congleton</a> and <a href="#GreenGrassLondon">London versions</a> are played by two lines
of children of about equal numbers. In the <a href="#GreenGrassFrodingham">Lincolnshire version</a>
the above description answers, except that when the last line
is sung every one claps hands. In the <a href="#GreenGrassHurst">Sussex version</a> the
child at the end of the line is taken over by the child who
sings the verses, and they lock their little fingers together
while singing the remainder.</p>

<p>Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) says:&mdash;&#8220;Two children advance and
retire on one side. When the opposite side says &#8216;Yes!&#8217; the two
take the first child in the row and dance round with her, singing
the remaining verse. This is called &#8216;the wedding.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="#GreenGrassLanarkshire">Lanarkshire version</a> is quite a different one, and contains
rather remarkable features. Mr. Black says that the game was
played entirely by girls, never by boys, and generally in the
months of May or June, about forty years ago. The children
sang with rather mincing and refined voices, evidently making an
effort in this direction. They walked, with their hands clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_163" id="PageI_163">[163]</a></span>
behind their backs, up and down the road. Each child was
crowned with rushes, and also had sashes or girdles of rushes.</p>

<p>Mr. Ballantyne says in his boyhood it was played by a row
of boys on one side and another of girls opposite. The boys
selected a girl when singing the third verse.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#GreenGrassRoxton">Roxton version</a>, one child at the end of the line of
children acts as &#8220;mother.&#8221; One child advances as &#8220;suitor,&#8221;
and says the three first verses. The &#8220;mother&#8221; replies with
the next line. The &#8220;suitor&#8221; chooses a girl and says the next
verse, and then all the children sing the last verse. This is
the same action as in <a href="#GreenGrassHalliwell">Halliwell&#8217;s version</a>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on <a href="#PageI_164">pp. 164</a>-<a href="#PageI_167">67</a>.
This analysis presents us with a very good example of the
changes caused by the game-rhymes being handed down by
tradition among people who have forgotten the original meaning
of the game. The first line in the <a href="#GreenGrassChambers">Scotch version</a> contains
the word &#8220;dis,&#8221; which is not known to the ordinary vocabulary.
Another word, of similar import, is &#8220;dik-ma-day&#8221; in
the <a href="#GreenGrassLanarkshire">Lanarkshire version</a>. Two other words occur, namely, &#8220;thegan&#8221;
in the <a href="#GreenGrassLanarkshire">Lanarkshire</a>, and &#8220;maycanameecan&#8221; in the <a href="#GreenGrassHurst">Sussex
versions</a>, which are also not to be found in ordinary vocabularies.
The two last words appear only once, and cannot,
therefore, be used for the purpose of tracing out an original
form of the game-rhyme, because on the system of analysis
adopted they may be arbitrary introductions and totally unconnected
with the original rhymes. This, however, is not the
case with the two first-mentioned words, and I am inclined to
consider them as forming part of the earliest version. The
word &#8220;dis&#8221; is carried through no less than ten out of the
fourteen variants, the gradation in the forms being as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_168" id="PageI_168">[168]</a></span>What the meaning of this word is it may be impossible to
ascertain, though probably Mr. Newell may be correct in his
suggestion that it represents the old English word &#8220;adist,&#8221;
the opposite of &#8220;ayont,&#8221; meaning &#8220;this way,&#8221; &#8220;come hither&#8221;
(<i>Games of American Children</i>, p. 51). But the point really
is, that the version which contains the oldest word-forms would
probably be the purest in other respects. The analysis of the
whole game confirms this view, as the <a href="#GreenGrassChambers">Scottish</a> and <a href="#GreenGrassYorkshire">Yorkshire
versions</a> are nearly parallel, while the discrepancies begin to
creep in with the <a href="#GreenGrassBerrington">Shropshire version</a>, reaching their last stage
in the versions recorded by <a href="#GreenGrassHalliwell">Halliwell</a> and from <a href="#GreenGrassCongleton">Congleton</a>.
Following this line of argument, &#8220;dik-ma-day&#8221; becomes first
&#8220;duke, my dear,&#8221; and then &#8220;duck, my dear.&#8221; Turning next
to the import of the rhymes, apart from special words used, it
is curious to note that &#8220;dis&#8221; is only converted into &#8220;dusty,&#8221;
and hence into &#8220;dusty day,&#8221; in two versions out of the fourteen.
The <a href="#GreenGrassFrodingham">Lincolnshire version</a> agrees with <a href="#GreenGrassHalliwell">Halliwell&#8217;s version</a>
in making some curious offers for a pretty lass, but these
rhymes are probably an innovation. In the same way the
incidents numbered 39-40, occurring in the <a href="#GreenGrassHurst">Sussex version</a>,
and 43-46 occurring in the <a href="#GreenGrassLondon">London</a> and <a href="#GreenGrassLiphook">Hants versions</a>, are
borrowings from other games, and not original portions of
this. The <a href="#GreenGrassCongleton">Congleton version</a> is evidently incomplete.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Henderson, in describing the curious rites accompanying
the saining or blessing of a corpse in the Scottish Lowlands,
states that empty dishes are arranged on the hearth as near as
possible to the fire, and after certain ceremonies in connection
therewith have been performed, the company join hands and
dance round the dishes, singing this burden:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A dis, a dis, a dis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A green griss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dis, a dis, a dis.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="source">&mdash;<i>Folk-lore of Northern Counties</i>, p. 54.</p>

<p>This rhyme is, it will be seen, the same as the first two
lines of the game, the word &#8220;griss&#8221; in the burial-rhyme becoming
&#8220;grass&#8221; in the game-rhyme, &#8220;grisse&#8221; being the old
form for &#8220;grass&#8221; or herb (Halliwell, <i>Provincial Glossary</i>, quotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_169" id="PageI_169">[169]</a></span>
a MS. authority for this). This identification of the game-rhyme
would suggest that the game originally was a child&#8217;s dramatic
imitation of an old burial ceremony, and it remains to be seen
whether the signification of the words would carry out this
idea.</p>

<p>In the first place, the idea of death is a prominent incident
in the game, appearing in seven out of the fourteen versions.
In all these cases the death is followed by the clapping of
hands and bell-ringing, and in five cases by the singing of birds.
Clapping of hands occurs in two other cases, and bell-ringing
in one other case, not accompanied by the death incident.
Now it is singular that the burial-rite which has just been
quoted is called Dish-a-loof; and a reference to the game of
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_190">Dish-a-loof</a>&#8221; [under that title], will show that it derives its
name from the clapping of hands. In the ceremony, as described
by Henderson, although songs and games are part of
the burial-ceremony, there is no specific mention of hand-clapping;
but it is conceivable that the action at one time
formed part of the ceremony, and hence the name &#8220;<a href="#GameI_190">Dish-a-loof</a>.&#8221;
This would not account for the promise of a duck,
drake, &amp;c., as in incidents Nos. 12 and 20; nor for the promise
of a young prince or young man; but these incidents might
very well be variants of some earlier forms which are not now
discoverable, especially as love-games were played at funerals,
and as the tendency, in the less complete forms of the game
as they have come down to us, is in the direction of transposing
the game into a complete love-game. The use of rushes in the
<a href="#GreenGrassLanarkshire">Lanarkshire game</a> might indicate the funeral garland (Aubrey&#8217;s
<i>Remaines</i>, pp. 109, 139). For clapping of hands to indicate
bell-tolling or bell-ringing at times of death see Napier&#8217;s <i>Folklore</i>,
p. 66. Henderson (p. 63) says the &#8220;passing bell&#8221; was
supposed in former times to serve two purposes: it called on
all good Christians within hearing to pray for the departing
spirit, and it scared away the evil spirits who were watching
to seize it, or at least to scare and terrify it.</p>

<p>On the whole evidence from the rhymes, therefore, I should
be disposed to class this game as originally belonging to burial,
and not love, rites.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_42">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The more general way of playing this game is to form a
ring of children simply. The children walk round singing the
verse as in the <a href="#GravelBelfast">Belfast version</a>, and when the last line is sung, the
child whose name is mentioned turns round, facing the outside
of the ring and having her back to the centre. She continues to
hold hands with the others, and dances round with them in that
position. This is repeated until all the children have &#8220;turned&#8221;
their backs to the inside of the ring. Here the game ends in
many cases, but another verse is sung in the <a href="#GravelLincoln">Lincoln, Winterton,
and Wakefield versions</a> from Miss Peacock, and this was
sung also in the London version. The second verse thus terminates
the game, with the players one by one reversing their
position and facing the centre of ring as at first. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_177" id="PageI_177">[177]</a></span>
<a href="#GravelDean">Forest of Dean</a> and <a href="#GravelWakefield">Wakefield versions</a> the action of the game
is somewhat different. A child stands in the centre of the ring
of children, without apparently taking much part in the game,
except to name the children in turn. In the <a href="#GravelWakefield">Wakefield version</a>,
however (Miss Fowler, No. xvii.), a little boy stands in the
middle of a circle of girls who sing the first verse. At &#8220;We&#8217;ll
all cou&#8217; don&#8217; together,&#8221; all crouch down, as if in profound
respect, then rising slowly, sing the next verse. After &#8220;My
pitcher and my can,&#8221; each child mentions her own name. At
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t &mdash;&mdash; as nice as her?&#8221; each mentions her sweetheart&#8217;s
name, and the child thus chosen goes into the circle. At the
end of the fourth verse they all clap hands, and the one that is
sweetheart to him in the middle kisses him. The &#8220;crouching
down&#8221; is also done in the <a href="#GravelDean">Forest of Dean version</a> when singing
the fourth line. The last one to stoop has to name her
sweetheart. When this is done, the children all dance round
and sing the other lines.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on pp. <a href="#PageI_178">178</a>-<a href="#PageI_181">181</a>.
The most constant formul&aelig; of this game-rhyme are shown
by this analysis to be Nos. 1, 6, 7, 13, 15, 18, 23, and the
variants, though important, are not sufficient to detract from
the significance of the normal version. It is evidently a funeral
game. The green gravel and the green grass indicate the
locality of the scene; &#8220;green,&#8221; as applied to gravel, may mean
freshly disturbed, just as green grave means a freshly made
grave. The tenant of the new grave is the well-loved lady
of a disconsolate lover, and probably the incidents of washing
and dressing the corpse, and putting an inscription on
the place where it is laid, are indicated by Nos. 13 and 15.
The dirge, or singing to the dead, is indicated by Nos. 18,
23, and 26, and the beauty of the first line is in complete
accord with the mournful music. That No. 26 occurs in only
two variants, <a href="#GravelDerbyshire">Derbyshire</a> and the <a href="#GravelMan">Isle of Man</a>, is curious, as
the pathos of this appeal is very apparent in the movement
of the game. The communion with the dead which is indicated
by No. 23 is by no means considered impossible by the
peasantry. In confirmation of this being a representation of
an old funeral ceremony, it may be pointed out that the action of turning backwards during the singing of the dirge is also
represented in the curious funeral ceremony called &#8220;Dish-a-loof,&#8221;
which is described in Henderson&#8217;s <i>Folk-lore of the Northern
Counties</i>, p. 53. Henderson&#8217;s words are: &#8220;All the attendants,
going out of the room, return into it backwards, repeating this
rhyme of &#8217;saining.&#8217;&#8221; The additional ceremony of marriage in
four of the games is clearly an interpolation, which may have
arisen from the custom of playing love and marriage games
at funerals and during the watching with the corpse, or may
be a mere transition to the more pleasant task of love-making
as the basis of a game. The <a href="#GravelDerbyshire">Derbyshire</a> incident (No. 24) may
indicate indeed that the funeral is that of a young bride, and
in that case the tendency to make the game wholly a marriage
game is accounted for. The decay which has set in is apparent
by the evident attempt to alter from &#8220;green gravel&#8221; to
&#8220;green grover&#8221; and &#8220;yellow gravel&#8221; (Nos. 4 and 5), and to
introduce pen and black ink (No. 17). The addition of the
incongruous elements from other games (Nos. 27-31) is a frequent
occurrence in modern games, and is the natural result of
decadence in the original form of the game. Altogether this
game-rhyme affords a very good example of the condition of
traditional games among the present generation of children.</p>

<a href="#GravelRedhill">Redhill (Surrey) version</a>, have been sent by Miss Blair (South
Shields); Mr. H. S. May, Ogbourne and Manton (Wilts);
Mrs. Haddon (Cambridge); Mrs. Harley (Lancashire); and
Miss Burne, Platt, near Wrotham (Kent). There are also
similar printed versions in <i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vi. 214 (Dorsetshire);
<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, v. 84 (Hersham, Surrey). Northall
prints a version in his <i>Folk Rhymes</i>, 362-3, identical with
No. 17. The tune of the Platt version sent by Miss Burne,
and the Ogbourne and Manton (H. S. May), are almost identical,
except the termination. This seems to be the most general
tune for the game. The <a href="#SongGravelLancashire">Lancashire tune</a> is the same as the
London version.</p>

<p>Miss Burne says of the <a href="#GravelMadeley">Madeley version</a>: &#8220;I never knew
&#8216;Green Gravel&#8217; and &#8216;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_257">Wallflowers</a>&#8217; played together as in this
way elsewhere (I had not got this variant when I wrote <i>Shropshire</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_183" id="PageI_183">[183]</a></span>
<i>Folk-lore</i>), except at Much Wenlock, where they reverse
the two verses, and only sing <i>one line</i> (the last) of &#8216;Green
Gravel.&#8217; But I feel sure they must have been <i>meant</i> to go
together (see my note in <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 510), and I
can explain them, I think. The ring of girls are dancing on
the green grass plot in the middle of an old-fashioned sixteenth-century
walled garden: each gets the news of her lover&#8217;s death,
and &#8216;turns her face to the wall,&#8217; the old token of hopeless
sorrow. Then they apostrophise the wallflowers in the border
surrounding the grass plot against the old high wall; and
here another variant explains the lament (second line)<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="i0">Wallflowers, wallflowers, growing up so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We shall all be maidens</i> [and so], we shall all die;<br /></span>

<p>Except the youngest (who will meet with another lover),
whether as an instance of the proverbial luck of the &#8216;youngest
born,&#8217; or as a piece of juvenile giddiness and inconstancy, I
cannot say; but considering the value set on true love and
hopeless constancy in the ballad-lore, and the special garland
which distinguished the funerals of bereaved but constant
maidens, and the solemnity of betrothal in old days, the latter
seems probable, especially considering the &#8216;for shame.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In <a href="#LeavesLincolnshire">Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire</a> the game is played
by the children forming a circle and dancing round, singing.
The first and third lines are sung three times. Partners are
chosen during the singing of the last line. Miss Peacock adds,
&#8220;The rest wanting, as my informant had forgotten the game.&#8221;
In the <a href="#LeavesSharleston">Sharleston version</a> the children march round two by
two, in a double circle, with one child in the centre, singing
the verse. At the conclusion, the children who are marching
on the inner side of the circle leave their partners and take the
place of one in front of them, while the centre child endeavours
to get one of the vacant places, the child turned out taking the
place of the one in the centre, when the game begins again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_185" id="PageI_185">[185]</a></span>
In the <a href="#LeavesEHeaton">Earls Heaton version</a> there is the circle of children, with
one child in the centre, who chooses a partner after the lines
have been sung.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) From this it would seem that while the <a href="#LeavesLincolnshire">Lincolnshire and
Nottinghamshire words</a> appear to be the most complete, the
action has been preserved best at <a href="#LeavesSharleston">Sharleston</a>. The acting of
this version is the same as that of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_351">The Jolly Miller</a>.&#8221; The
third variant is evidently an imitation of the song, &#8220;John
Brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One couple is chosen to lead, and they go off, whither they
will, followed by a long train of youths and maidens, all singing
the refrain. Sometimes the leaders part company, and
branch off to the right or left; the others have to do the same,
and not until the leaders meet can they join again. They
march arm in arm.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Mr. R. S. Baker, who records this, says a Wellingborough
lady sent him the tune and words, and told him the game was<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_186" id="PageI_186">[186]</a></span>

<h3><a name="GameI_254" id="GameI_254"></a>Gully</h3>

<p>A sink, or, failing that, a particular stone in the pavement
was the &#8220;Gully.&#8221; Some boy chosen by lot, or one who volunteered
in order to start the game, laid his top on the ground at
some distance from the &#8220;Gully.&#8221; The first player then spun
his top, pegging at the recumbent top, so as to draw it towards
the &#8220;Gully.&#8221; If he missed the top, he stooped down and took
up his own top by pushing his hand against it in such a
manner that the space between his first and second finger
caught against the peg and forced the top into the palm of his
hand. He then had &#8220;a go&#8221; at the recumbent top (I forget
what this was called), and sent his own top against it so as to
push it towards the &#8220;Gully.&#8221; If he missed, he tried again and
again, until his own top could spin no longer. If he did not
hit the top with his own while it was spinning, his top had to
be laid down and the other one taken up, and its owner took
his turn at pegging. When a spinning-top showed signs of
exhaustion, and the taking it up might kill it, and it was not
very far from the down-lying top, its owner would gently push
it with his finger, so as to make it touch the other top, and so
avoid putting it into the other&#8217;s place. This was called &#8220;kissing,&#8221;
and was not allowed by some players. When one player
succeeded in sending the top into the &#8220;Gully,&#8221; he took it up
and fixed it by its peg into a post, mortar of a wall, or the best
place where it could be tolerably steady. Holding it by one
hand, he drove the peg of his own top as far as he could into
the crown of the victim top. This was called &#8220;taking a grudge.&#8221;
He then held either his own or the victim top and knocked the
other against the wall, the object being to split the victim. He
was allowed three &#8220;grudges.&#8221; If the top did not give way,
the other players tried in turn. If the top did not split, it was
returned to its owner, but any boy who succeeded in splitting
it through the middle, so that the peg fell out, took possession
of the peg. I have seen a top split at the side in such a way
as to be quite useless as a top, though no peg was gained. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_187" id="PageI_187">[187]</a></span>
remember, too, a schoolfellow of mine drawing from his pocket
some seven or eight pegs, the trophied memorials of as many
tops.&mdash;London (J. P. Emslie).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_255" id="GameI_255"></a>Hairry my Bossie</h3>

<p>This is a game of chance. The players are two, and may
be boys or girls, or a boy and a girl. The stakes may be pins,
buttons, marbles, or anything for which children gamble. One
player puts a number, one, two, three or more, of the articles
to be gambled for into the hollow of the closed hand, and
says, &#8220;Hairry my bossie;&#8221; the other answers, &#8220;Knock &#8217;im
down,&#8221; upon which he puts his closed hands down with a blow
on his knees, and continues to strike them upwards and downwards
on the knee, so as to give the opponent in play an idea of
the number of objects concealed by the sound given forth. He
then says, &#8220;How many blows?&#8221; and gets the reply, &#8220;As
many&#8217;s goes.&#8221; A guess is then made. If the guess is correct
the guesser gets the objects. If the guess is incorrect the
guesser has to make up the difference between the number
guessed and the real number. The players play alternately.
This game was played for the most part at Christmas.&mdash;Keith
(Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Hairry = &#8220;rob,&#8221; Bossie = &#8220;a wooden bowl,&#8221; commonly
used for making the leaven in baking oat-cakes, and for making
&#8220;brose.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a very general game amongst schoolboys.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_256" id="GameI_256"></a>Half-Hammer</h3>

<p>The game of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_312">Hop-step-and-jump</a>,&#8221; Norfolk. This game is
played in the west of Sussex, but not in the east. It is played
thus by two or more boys. Each boy in his turn stands first
on one leg and makes a hop, then strides or steps, and lastly,
putting both feet together, jumps. The boy who covers the
most ground is the victor.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_257" id="GameI_257"></a>Han&#8217;-and-Hail</h3>

<p>A game common in Dumfries, thus described by Jamieson.
Two goals called hails, or dules, are fixed on at about a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_188" id="PageI_188">[188]</a></span>
of four hundred yards. The two parties then place themselves
in the middle between the goals or dules, and one of the
players, taking a soft elastic ball, about the size of a man&#8217;s fist,
tosses it into the air, and, as it falls, strikes it with his palm
towards his antagonists. The object of the game is for either
party to drive the ball beyond the goal which lies before them,
while their opponents do all in their power to prevent this.
As soon as the ball is gowf&#8217;t, that is, struck away, the opposite
party endeavour to intercept it in its fall. This is called keppan&#8217;
the ba&#8217;. If they succeed in this attempt, the player who does
so is entitled to throw the ball with all his might towards
his antagonists. If he kep it in the first bound which it makes
off the ground, called a stot, he is allowed to haunch, that is,
to throw the ball by bringing his hand with a sweep past his
thigh, to which he gives a stroke as his hand passes, and discharging
the ball at the moment when the stroke is given. If
the ball be caught in the second bounce, the catcher may hoch
the ball, that is, throw it through below one of his houghs. If
none of the party catch the ball, it must be gowf&#8217;t in the
manner before described. As soon as either of the parties
succeed in driving the ball, or, as it is called, hailin&#8217; the dules,
the game then begins by one of the party which was successful
throwing the ball towards the opposing goal and the other party
striving to drive it back.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_258" id="GameI_258"></a>Hand in and Hand out</h3>

<p>A game played by a company of young people who are drawn
up in a circle, when one of them, pitched upon by lot, walks
round the band, and, if a boy, hits a girl, or, if a girl, she strikes
a boy whom she chooses, on which the party striking and the
party struck run in pursuit of each other till the latter is caught,
whose lot it then becomes to perform the same part. A game
so called was forbidden by statute of Edward IV.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s
<i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>A game in which one of the players turns his face to the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_189" id="PageI_189">[189]</a></span>
his hand resting upon his back. He must continue in position
until he guesses who struck his hand, when the striker takes

<p>(<i>b</i>) The hands are closed, some small article is put in one of
them behind the back of the player. The closed fists are then
turned rapidly round one another while the rhyme is being
said, and they are then placed one on top of the other. A guess
is then made by any one of the players as to which hand the
object is in. If correct, the guesser obtains the object; if
incorrect, the player who performs &#8220;Handy dandy&#8221; keeps it.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is mentioned in <i>Piers Plowman</i>, p. 69 of
Wright&#8217;s edition. Douce quotes an ancient MS. which curiously
mentions the game as &#8220;men play with little children at
&#8216;handye-dandye,&#8217; which hand will you have&#8221; (ii. 167). Johnson
says: &#8220;&#8216;Handy dandy,&#8217; a play in which children change
hands and places: &#8216;See how yon justice rails upon yon simple
thief! Hark, in thine ear: change places, and, handy dandy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_190" id="PageI_190">[190]</a></span>
which is the justice, which is the thief?&#8221; (<i>King Lear</i>, iv. 6).
Malone says, &#8220;&#8216;Handy dandy&#8217; is, I believe, a play among
children, in which something is shaken between two hands,
and then a guess is made in which hand it is retained.&#8221; See
Florio&#8217;s <i>Italian Dictionary</i>, 1598: &#8220;Bazzicchiare, to shake
between the hands; to play &#8216;Handy dandy.&#8217;&#8221; Pope, in his
<i>Memoirs of Cornelius Scriblerus</i>, in forbidding certain sports
to his son Martin till he is better informed of their antiquity,
says: &#8220;Neither <a href="#GameI_165">cross and pile</a>, nor <a href="#GameI_204">ducks and drakes</a>, are quite
so ancient as &#8216;Handy dandy,&#8217; though Macrobius and St. Augustine
take notice of the first, and Minutius Foelix describes the
latter; but &#8216;Handy dandy&#8217; is mentioned by Aristotle, Plato,
and Aristophanes.&#8221; Browne, in <i>Britannia&#8217;s Pastorals</i> (i. 5),
also alludes to the game.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_261" id="GameI_261"></a>Hap the Beds</h3>

<p>A singular game, gone through by hopping on one foot, and
with that foot sliding a little flat stone out of an oblong bed,
rudely drawn on a smooth piece of ground. This bed is
divided into eight parts, the two of which at the farther end
of it are called the Kail-pots. If the player then stands at one
end, and pitches the smooth stone into all the divisions one
after the other, following the same on a foot (at every throw),
and bringing it out of the figure, this player wins not only the
game, but is considered a first-rate daub at it; failing, however,
to go through all the parts so, without missing either a
throw or a hop, yet keeping before the other gamblers (for
many play at one bed), still wins the curious rustic game.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s
<i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>.</p>

<p>A game called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_37">The Beds</a>,&#8221; mentioned by a writer in <i>Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, August 1821, p. 36, as played in Edinburgh
when he was a boy by girls only, is described as a game
where a pitcher is kicked into chalked divisions of the pavement,
the performer being on one leg and hopping.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_263" id="GameI_263"></a>Hare and Hounds</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game. One boy is chosen as the Hare. He carries
with him a bag filled with strips of paper. The rest of the
boys are the Hounds. The Hare has a certain time (say
fifteen minutes) allowed him for a start, and he goes across
country, scattering some paper on his way in order to indicate
his track. He may employ any man&oelig;uvre in order to deceive
his pursuers, but must keep up the continuity of his paper
track-signs. The Hounds follow him and try to catch him
before he gets home, which is a place agreed upon beforehand.&mdash;London

<p class="source">&mdash;Sporle, Norfolk (Miss Matthews).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the <a href="#HarkDeptford">Deptford version</a> two girls join hands, holding
them up as an arch for the other players to tramp through.
The first two verses are sung first by one and then by the other
of the two girls. At the finish of these the girl then going
through the arch is stopped, and the third, fourth, and fifth
verses are sung by the two girls alternately. Then finally both
girls sing the last verse, and the child is sent as prisoner
behind one or other of the two girls. The verses are then
begun again, and repeated afresh for each of the troop marching
through the arch until all of them are placed behind one
or other of the two girls. The two sides thus formed then
proceed to tug against each other, and the strongest side wins
the game.</p>

<p>The <a href="#HarkBelfast">Belfast version</a> is practically the same, except that the
verses are not sung as a dialogue, but by all the players
together, and the prisoner, when caught, has the choice of
sides, by being asked, &#8220;Which will you have, a golden apple
or golden pear?&#8221; and according to the answer given is sent
behind one of the leaders. The <a href="#HarkSporle">Norfolk</a> and <a href="#HarkTong">Shropshire games</a>
are different. Miss Matthews thus describes the <a href="#HarkSporle">Norfolk game</a>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_198" id="PageI_198">[198]</a></span>
&#8220;Two girls take hold of hands, and another, the
prisoner, stands between them. The rest form themselves into
a line opposite, and advance and retreat while singing the first
verse, the gaolers singing the next verse, and so on alternately.
[At the end of the last verse but one] the children break
the line, form themselves into a ring, and dance round the
prisoner, singing the final verse.&#8221; Miss Harley describes the
<a href="#HarkTong">Shropshire version</a> as follows: &#8220;The first six verses are sung
by the alternate parties, who advance and retire, tramping
their feet, at first, to imitate the robbers. The last verse is
sung altogether going round in a ring.&#8221; In the <a href="#HarkShipley">Shipley
version</a>, Miss Busk says: &#8220;The children form themselves into
two lines, while two or three, representing the robbers, swagger
along between them. When the robbers sing the last verse
they should have attained the end of the lines [of children], as
during the parley they were safe; having pronounced the defiance
they run away. The children in the lines rush after
them, and should catch them and put them in prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The analysis of this game is easy. The <a href="#HarkDeptford">Deptford</a>, <a href="#HarkBelfast">Belfast</a>,
and <a href="#HarkWolstanton">Wolstanton versions</a> are clearly enough dramatic
representations of the capture of a robber, and probably the
game dates from the period of the prevalence of highway
robbery. The Wolstanton version shows us that the game is
breaking up from its earlier form, while the Norfolk and Shropshire
versions show a fresh development into the mere game
for children, apart from its original significance. The action of
the game confirms this view. The <a href="#HarkSporle">Norfolk action</a> seems to
be the most nearly perfect in its dramatic significance, and the
<a href="#HarkTong">Shropshire action</a> comes next. The action of the other games
seems to have been grafted on to the superior form of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_10">Oranges
and Lemons</a>.&#8221; It is probable that this fact has preserved the
words more completely than in the other cases, where the force
of the robber action would become less and less as actual experience
of robbers and robbery died out. Altogether, this
game supplies a very good example of the change produced in
games by changes in the actual life which gave rise to them.
It is singular that the verses of this game also enter into the
composition of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_396">London Bridge is broken down</a>.&#8221; It is probable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_199" id="PageI_199">[199]</a></span>
therefore, that it may be an altered form of the game of
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_396">London Bridge</a>.&#8221; The refrain, &#8220;My fair lady,&#8221; occurs in
both games.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_266" id="GameI_266"></a>Hats in Holes</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game. The players range their hats in a row against
the wall, and each boy in turn pitches a ball from a line at some
twenty-five feet distance into one of the hats. The boy into
whose hat it falls has to seize it and throw it at one or other of
the others, who all scamper off when the ball is &#8220;packed in.&#8221;
If he fails to hit he is out, and takes his cap up. The boy
whose cap is left at the last has to &#8220;cork&#8221; the others, that is,
to throw the ball at their bent backs, each in turn stooping
down to take his punishment.&mdash;Somerset (Elworthy&#8217;s <i>Dialect</i>).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_267" id="GameI_267"></a>Hattie</h3>

<p>A game with preens, pins, on the crown of a hat. Two or
more may play. Each lays on a pin, then with the hand they
strike the side of the hat time about, and whoever makes the
pins by a stroke cross each other, lifts those so crossed.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s
<i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_268" id="GameI_268"></a>Hawkey</h3>

<p>A game played by several boys on each side with sticks
called &#8220;hawkey bats,&#8221; and a ball. A line is drawn across
the middle of the ground from one side to the other; one party
stands on one side of the line and the opposite party on the
other, and neither must overstep this boundary, but are allowed
to reach over as far as their bats will permit to strike the ball.
The object is to strike the ball to the farther end to touch the
fence of the opposing party&#8217;s side, when the party so striking
the ball scores one, and, supposing nine to be the game, the
party obtaining that number first of course wins the game.&mdash;West
Sussex (Holloway&#8217;s <i>Dict. of Provincialisms</i>).</p>

<p>See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_25">Bandy</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_191">Doddart</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_298">Hockey</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_269" id="GameI_269"></a>Headicks and Pinticks</h3>

<p>This game was played only at Christmas. The number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_200" id="PageI_200">[200]</a></span>
players was two. The stakes were pins. One player laid in
the hollow of the hand, or on one of the forefingers, a pin, and
then placed the other forefinger over it so as to conceal it. He
then held up his hand to his opponent and said, &#8220;Headicks or
pinticks?&#8221; His opponent made a guess by pointing with his
finger and saying &#8220;Headicks,&#8221; or &#8220;Pinticks.&#8221; If the guess
was correct he gained the pin, but if it was incorrect he forfeited
one. The players played alternately.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W.
Gregor).</p>

<p>Another version seems to be &#8220;Headim and Corsim.&#8221; Pins
are hid with fingers in the palms of the hands; the same number
is laid alongside them, and either &#8220;Headim&#8221; or &#8220;Corsim&#8221;
called out by those who do so. When the fingers are lifted, if
the heads of the pins hid and those beside them be lying one
way when the crier cried &#8220;Headim,&#8221; then that player wins;
but if &#8220;Corsim,&#8221; the one who hid the pins wins. This is the
king of all the games at the preens.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian
Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>.</p>

<p>The editors of Jamieson&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i> say that the name
should be &#8220;Headum and Corsum.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_270" id="GameI_270"></a>Heads and Tails</h3>

<p>That plan for deciding matters by the &#8220;birl o&#8217; a bawbee.&#8221;
The one side cries &#8220;Heads&#8221; (when the piece is whirling in the
air) and the other &#8220;Tails,&#8221; so whichever is uppermost when
the piece alights that gains or settles the matter, heads standing
for the King&#8217;s head and tails for the figure who represents
Britannia.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>. This is
a general form of determining sides or beginning a game all
over the country.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_271" id="GameI_271"></a>Hecklebirnie</h3>

<p>A play among children in Aberdeenshire. Thirty or forty
children in two rows, joining opposite hands, strike smartly
with their hands thus joined on the head or shoulders of their
companion as he runs the gauntlet through them. This is called
&#8220;passing through the mires of Hecklebirnie.&#8221;&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<p>The editors of Jamieson append a lengthy note connecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_201" id="PageI_201">[201]</a></span>
the name of this game with the northern belief that the wicked
were condemned to suffer eternal punishment in Hecla, the
volcanic mountain in Iceland.</p>

<p>The game is played in the usual manner of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_227">Fox and
Goose</a>&#8221; games. One is chosen to be the Hen, and one to be
the Fox. The rest are the Chickens. The Chickens take hold
of each other&#8217;s waists, the first one holding the Hen&#8217;s waist.
At the end of the dialogue the Fox tries to get hold of one of
the chickens. If he succeeds in catching them, they all with
the Fox try to dodge the Hen, who makes an effort to regain
them.</p>

<p>It is known at Winterton under the name of &#8220;Pins and
Needles.&#8221; The players stand in a row, one behind another,
with one of the party as their Leader. Another player, called
&#8220;Outsider,&#8221; pretends to scratch the ground. The Leader asks,
the questions, and the Outsider replies<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

one of the children at the further end of the row, the Leader

succeeds, the child caught takes her place, and the game is
recommenced.&mdash;Winterton (Miss M. Peacock).</p>

<p>The children form a ring around one of the party, who sits
in the middle, and says the two first lines. Then those in the
circle dance round her, singing the next four lines. This is
repeated three times, with the refrain, &#8220;On a cold,&#8221; &amp;c., after
which the dancing and singing cease, and the child is asked,
&#8220;Sugar, sweet, or vinegar, sour?&#8221; Her answer is always

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed by the players joining hands, one child
standing in the centre. The ring dance round singing the
first four lines. At the fourth line the child in the centre
chooses one from the ring, who goes into the centre with her.
The marriage formula or chorus is then sung, the two kiss,
and the one who was first in the centre joins the ring, the
second one choosing another in her turn. Played by both
boys and girls.</p>

singing. The one in the middle chooses another before the
four last lines are sung. Then the rest dance round singing
these lines, and kiss each other.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It is evident that these words comprise two distinct games,
which have become mixed in some inexplicable fashion. The
first six lines and the last four are one game, a ring form, with
the marriage formula and blessing. The other portion of the
game is a dialogue game, evidently having had two lines of
players, questions being asked and answers given. It is, in

<p>The children are seated, and the questions are put by one of
the party who holds a twisted handkerchief or something of
the sort in the hand. The handkerchief was called &#8220;hewley
puley,&#8221; and the questions are asked by the child who holds it.
If one answers wrongly, a box on the ear with the handkerchief
was the consequence; but if they all replied correctly, the one

<p>(<i>b</i>) In <a href="#WullieBiggar">Biggar</a>, all the players were seated round the hearthstone,
lads on one side, lassies the other; one lad rising up
said the first verse, then one acting as &#8220;maister&#8221; said the next
verse. The young man then said the next two lines, to which
the other replied in the two following, and naming at the close
any girl he thought would be acceptable. If the lad was pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_210" id="PageI_210">[210]</a></span>
he sang the next verse. If he was not pleased with the girl
offered him he replied in either of the three following verses.
The first of the three was generally said if the girl was thought
to be too old; if bad-tempered, the second. If the lad found
no fault, but wished to politely refuse, he sang the last verse.
The girl then was asked in her turn, and the same formula
gone through, she saying either of the three last verses given.
Forfeits were demanded for every refusal, and were cried at
the end of the game.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Mr. Ballantyne writes: &#8220;This game was a great favourite
in my father&#8217;s house. This was a forfeit game, forfeits being
called &#8216;wadds.&#8217;&#8221; Chambers, <i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 124, gives a
version of this game. It is practically the same as <a href="#WullieBiggar">Mr. Ballantyne&#8217;s
version</a>, with only a few verbal differences. Mactaggart
says, &#8220;The chief drift of this singular game seemed to be to
discover the sweethearts of one another,&#8221; and such discoveries
are thought valuable, but not so much as they were anciently.
In any case, it appears to me that the game is an early one, or,
at all events, a reflection of early custom.</p>

<p>The words are said by the one who has to find the person
hidden.</p>

<p>In Scotland the game is called &#8220;Hospy,&#8221; and is played by
boys only, and it can be played only in a village or hamlet in
which there is the means of hiding. A Spy is chosen, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_212" id="PageI_212">[212]</a></span>
spot, called Parley, is fixed upon at which the Spy stands till
all the other players are hid, and to which he can run when
pursued. When the players are hid, the cry, &#8220;Hospy,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>,
&#8220;Ho! spy!&#8221; is raised by them. The Spy then sets out to
find them. The moment he detects one he turns and runs
with all his might to the Parley, pursued by the one he has
discovered. If he is overtaken, he must carry on his back the
pursuer to the Parley. The same thing is gone through till all
the players are discovered.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>Jamieson says, &#8220;&#8216;Hy Spy,&#8217; a game resembling &#8216;Hide and
Seek,&#8217; but played in a different manner. The station, which in
England is called Home, is here the Den, and those who keep
it are the Seekers, and are called the Ins. Those who hide
themselves, instead of crying &#8216;Hoop,&#8217; as in England, cry &#8216;Hy
spy;&#8217; and they are denominated the Outs. The business of
the Ins is, after the signal is given, to lay hold of the Outs
before they can reach the den. The captive then becomes one
of the Ins; for the honour of the game consists in the privilege
of hiding oneself.&#8221; Jamieson adds, &#8220;Hy is still used in calling
after a person, to excite attention, or when it is wished to warn
him to get out of the way.&#8221; Strutt describes it as &#8220;Harry-Racket,&#8221;
or &#8220;Hide and Seek&#8221; (<i>Sports</i>, p. 381).</p>

<p>At Cork two sides are chosen for Spy; one side hides while
the other side hunts. When the hunters see one of the hidden
players, they call out, &#8220;I spy &mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; and the child&#8217;s name. The
player called must run after the Spy and try to catch him
before he reaches his Den; if he succeeds, the one caught must
go to the opposite side of players, then next time the spies
hide, and those who have been hiding, spy (Miss Keane). A
more general form of the game is for one child to hide, and to
make a noise in a disguised voice to give notice of his whereabouts,
or to call out &#8220;Whoop!&#8221; or &#8220;Coo!&#8221; Until this noise
or call is made, the searchers may not seek him. If when
spied or discovered the hider cannot reach home before being
caught, he again has to hide (A. B. Gomme).</p>

Seek.&#8221; It is curious that, in Haynes Bayly&#8217;s song, the bridegroom&#8217;s
name should be Lovell. There is no mention on the
monument of the name of the bereaved husband. The father,
Edward Lovell, was fourteen years rector of Bawdrip and
fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and died in 1675, and so
could not have been present at the wedding, as represented in
the song. He came from Batcombe, near Castle-Cary; at
which latter place the Lovells were seated in very early days.&mdash;<i>Notes
and Queries</i>, 4th Ser., ix. 477.</p>

<p>Cope (<i>Hampshire Glossary</i>) calls the game &#8220;I spy I.&#8221;
Lowsley (<i>Berkshire Glossary</i>) says, &#8220;In playing this game, the
seeker has to call out &#8216;I spy!&#8217; to the one he finds before
he may start for home.&#8221; It is called &#8220;Hy Spy&#8221; in Patterson&#8217;s
<i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>; Evans&#8217; <i>Leicestershire Glossary</i>,
&#8220;Hide and Wink;&#8221; Barnes&#8217; <i>Dorset Glossary</i>, &#8220;Hidy Buck.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Pegge&#8217;s <i>Alphabet of Kenticisms</i> the game is given as
&#8220;Hide and Fox.&#8221; <i>Cf.</i> &#8220;Hide Fox, and all after,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, let the
fox hide and the others go to seek him; Hamlet, iv. 2, 32.
In Stead&#8217;s <i>Holderness Glossary</i>, &#8220;Hed-o.&#8221; In the North
Riding it is &#8220;Lam-pie-sote-it,&#8221; also called &#8220;Felto&#8221; in Robinson&#8217;s
<i>Whitby Glossary</i>. He also mentions that the hidden child
cries &#8220;How-ly&#8221; to the finder. Apparently the same as the
south country &#8220;Whoop,&#8221; a signal to the finder to begin the
search. Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) says this game is called
&#8220;Felt and Laite.&#8221; Holland (<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>) speaks of it
as &#8220;I Spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>One child hides an article, while those who are to search
for it go in another room (or out of the way somewhere). When
it is hidden, they are called to find it by one of the above
rhymes being sung or said. The searchers are enabled more
readily to find the hidden article by being told &#8220;hot,&#8221; &#8220;very
hot,&#8221; &#8220;scorching,&#8221; &#8220;burning,&#8221; or &#8220;cold,&#8221; &#8220;very cold,&#8221; and
&#8220;freezing,&#8221; when near to or far from the hidden article.
Sometimes several may agree to hide the article, and only one
to be the finder. In the <a href="#Hide2Penzance">Penzance game</a> one child is blindfolded,
other children hide something, then shout the words. Search
is then made for the hidden object: when found, the finder in
his turn is blindfolded. There appears to be some mistake in
the description of this game.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_290" id="GameI_290"></a>Hiss and Clap</h3>

<p>All the boys are requested to leave the room, when the girls
take their seats, leaving a vacant place on the right side of
each girl for the gentleman of her choice. Each boy in turn
is then summoned by another who acts as doorkeeper, and
asked to guess which lady he imagines has chosen him for her
partner. Should he guess rightly he is allowed to take his
seat by the lady who has chosen him, while the other girls
loudly clap hands. Should he guess wrongly he is hissed, and
sent out of the room by the doorkeeper.&mdash;Cork, Ireland (Miss
Keane).</p>

<p>At Long Eaton in Nottinghamshire Miss Youngman records
a similar game to this, with a rhyme that is probably taken
from a popular song or ballad. The successful candidate for
the girl&#8217;s choice claims a kiss, but if unsuccessful he is beaten
out of the room with knotted handkerchiefs.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_29">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>When a number of boys agree to have a game at the Pearie
or peg-top, a circle is drawn on the ground, within which all
the tops must strike and spin. If any of them bounce out of
the circle without spinning, it is called a Hoatie. The punishment
to which the Hoatie is subjected consists in being placed
in the ring, while all the boys whose tops ran fairly have the
privilege of striking&mdash;or, as it is called, &#8220;deggin&#8221;&mdash;it till it is
either split or struck out of the circle. If either of these take
place, the boy to whom the Hoatie belonged has the privilege
of playing again.&mdash;Upper Lanarkshire (Jamieson).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_298" id="GameI_298"></a>Hockey</h3>

<p>This game is played with a solid indiarubber ball from two
to two and a half inches in diameter. The players each have
a bent or hooked stick or &#8220;hockey.&#8221; They take opposite sides.
The object of the game is for each side to drive the ball through<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_217" id="PageI_217">[217]</a></span>
their opponents&#8217; goal. The goals are each marked by two poles
standing about eight to ten feet apart, and boundaries are
marked at the sides. The ball is placed in the middle of the
ground. It is started by two players who stand opposite each
other, the ball lying between their two sticks. They first touch
the ground with their hockey-sticks, then they touch or strike
their opponents&#8217; stick. This is repeated three times. At the
third stroke they both try to hit the ball away. The ball may
only be played by a hockey-stick, and a goal is gained when
the ball is played between the posts by the opposing party.&mdash;Barnes
(A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In Ross and Stead&#8217;s <i>Holderness Glossary</i> this game is
described under the name of &#8220;Shinnup.&#8221; Robinson (<i>Mid
Yorkshire Glossary</i>) gives it under &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_139">Shinnops</a>,&#8221; a youth&#8217;s game
with a ball and stick, heavy at the striking end, the player
man&oelig;uvring to get as many strokes as possible and to drive
the ball distances. &#8220;Shinnoping&#8221; is also used for the game in
operation. &#8220;Jowling,&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="#GameI_354">Jowls</a>,&#8221; is given in Robinson&#8217;s
<i>Whitby Glossary</i>, as a game played much the same as
&#8220;Hockey.&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_16">Baddin</a>&#8221; is the name given to it in Holland&#8217;s

<p>(<i>c</i>) An old custom in vogue in bygone days was Rotherham
Fair, or what was called &#8220;Whipping Toms,&#8221; which took place in
the Newarkes every Shrove Tuesday. So soon as the pancake
bell rang men and boys assembled with sticks having a knob
or hook at the end. A wooden ball was thrown down, and two
parties engaged in striving which could get the ball by striking
it with their sticks to one end of the Newarke first&mdash;those who
did so were the victors. This game was called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_139">Shinney</a>,&#8221; or
&#8220;Hockey.&#8221; About one o&#8217;clock the Whipping Toms appeared on
the scene of action. These were three men clad in blue smock
frocks, with very long waggon whips, who were accompanied by
three men with small bells. They commenced driving the men
and boys out of the Newarkes. It was very dangerous sometimes;
they would lash the whip in such a manner round the
legs of those they were pursuing as to throw them down, which
produced laughter and shouting. Some would stop, and turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_218" id="PageI_218">[218]</a></span>
to the whipper and say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a pennyworth,&#8221; and he
would guard and parry off the lashes with his shinney stick.
When the whipper was successful in lashing him he demanded
his penny, and continued lashing until he paid. This was
continued until five o&#8217;clock, then the game terminated. This
was suppressed, I believe, in 1847. At that period it was a
prevalent idea that it could not be abolished, as it was connected
with an &#8220;old charter.&#8221; It is believed in the town that
this custom was to commemorate the driving out of the Danes
from the Newarkes at the time they besieged Leicester.&mdash;Leicester

<p>The purchaser goes round, pretending to taste each one in
turn, inquiring the price and weight; finds fault with several,
one being too sweet and the other not fresh enough, and so on.
When one honey pot is discovered to the purchaser&#8217;s taste, she
is lifted by the purchaser and owner, or by two children who
act as weights or scales, and then swung by her arms backwards
and forwards to estimate her weight and price (<a href="#Fig219">fig. 2</a>).
As long as the child can keep her hands clasped, so long is the
swinging kept up; and as many times as they count, so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_220" id="PageI_220">[220]</a></span>

<p>They were not brought back, and the &#8220;owner&#8221; had to catch
and bring back each one. When sold, the honey pot is taken
to the other side, or &#8220;home&#8221; of the purchaser. The game
goes on till all the honey pots are sold.&mdash;London (A. B.

<p>At the last bar they swung the child higher and higher, and at
the last note they swung it as high as they could. I believe
the last note in the music should be G, but it was raised to
give effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Scotland the game is called &#8220;Hinnie Pigs,&#8221; and is played
as follows. The boys sit down in rows, hands locked beneath
their hams. Round comes one of them, the honey merchant,
who feels those who are sweet and sour, by lifting them by the
arm-pits and giving them three shakes. If they stand these
without the hands unlocking below they are then sweet and
saleable, fit for being office-bearers of other ploys.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s
<i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>.</p>

<p>In Ross and Stead&#8217;s <i>Holderness Glossary</i> this is described as
a girls&#8217; game, in which two carry a third as a pot of honey to
market. It is mentioned by Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) and
by Holland (<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>). Mr. Holland adds, &#8220;If the
hands give way before twenty is reached it is counted a bad
honey pot; if not, it is a good one.&#8221;</p>

is taken into an open field on the north side of the church, to
be contended for by the youths assembled for that purpose.
When the Hood is about to be thrown up, the Plough-bullocks
or Boggins, as they are called, dressed in scarlet jackets, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_222" id="PageI_222">[222]</a></span>
placed amongst the crowd at certain distances. Their persons
are sacred, and if amidst the general row the Hood falls into
the hands of one of them, the sport begins again. The object
of the person who seizes the Hood is to carry off the prize to
some public-house in the town, where he is rewarded with
such liquor as he chooses to call for. This pastime is said to
have been instituted by the Mowbrays, and that the person
who furnished the Hood did so as a tenure by which he held
some land under the lord. How far this tradition may be
founded on fact I do not know, but no person now acknowledges
to hold any land by that tenure.&mdash;Stonehouse&#8217;s <i>Isle of
Axholme</i>, p. 291.</p>

<p>W. J. Woolhouse (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 2nd series, v. 95)
says when the Hood is thrown up by the Chief of the Boggons
or by the officials, it becomes the object of the villagers to get
the Hood to their own village, the other eleven men, called
Boggons, being stationed at the corners and sides of the field,
to prevent, if possible, its being thrown out of the field; and
should it chance to fall into any of their hands, it is &#8220;boggoned,&#8221;
and forthwith returned to the chief, who again throws
it up, as at the commencement of the game. The next day is
occupied by the Boggons going round the villages singing as
waits, and they are regaled with hot furmenty; from some
they get coppers given them, and from others a small measure
of wheat. The day after that they assume the character of
Plough-bullocks, and at a certain part of Westwood-side they
&#8220;smoke the Fool&#8221;&mdash;that is, straw is brought by those who
like, and piled in a heap, a rope being tied or slung over the
branches of the tree next to the pile of straw; the other end of
the rope is fastened round the waist of the Fool, and he is
drawn up and fire is put to the straw, the Fool being swung
to and fro through the smoke until he is well-nigh choked,
after which he goes round and collects whatever the spectators
choose to give him. The sport is then at an end till the next
year. The land left by Lady Mowbray was forty acres, which
are known by the name of &#8220;Hoodlands,&#8221; and the Boggons&#8217;
dresses and the Hood are made from its proceeds.</p>

<p>In the contiguous parish of Epworth a similar game is played<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_223" id="PageI_223">[223]</a></span>
under the same name, but with some variations. The Hood
is not here carried away from the field, but to certain goals,
against which it is struck three times and then declared free.
This is called &#8220;wyking&#8221; the Hood, which is afterwards thrown
up again for a fresh game.&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 6th series,
vii. 148.</p>

<p>A game, the object of which is to eject a stone, slate, or
&#8220;dump&#8221; out of a form linearly marked on the ground in
different directions, by hopping without touching any of the
lines.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_224" id="PageI_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>In the plan (<a href="#Fig224">fig. 8</a>) the players first lay the stone on the back
of the hand, and <i>walk</i> through the plan, stepping into each
division, throw it up and catch it. Then the stone is <i>thrown</i>
back from No. 7 outside No. 1. Now it is placed on the toe,
and the child walks through again, throwing up the foot when
out, to catch the stone in the hand. Another way, done on the
same plan, is for the player to place the stone in No. 1, leave
it there, and hop into each division and back, then place it
in No. 2, and repeat the hopping, and so on through all the
figures. There is no <i>kicking</i> of the stone, as is usual in
London.&mdash;Roxton, St. Neots (Miss Lumley).</p>

</div>

<p>From Crockham Hill, Kent, Miss Chase sends four versions.
In the first plan (<a href="#Fig224">fig. 1</a>) the game is:&mdash;Throw stone into No. 1.
Hop from No. 1 to No. 5 and back. Then pick it up. So on
successively. After having thrown it into No. 5, begin to reverse
by throwing stone into No. 1 while standing at No. 5&mdash;return
with it on your thumb. Throw into No. 2&mdash;return with stone
on your eye. Throw into No. 3&mdash;return with stone in your
palm. Throw into No. 4&mdash;return with stone on your head.
Throw into No. 5&mdash;return with stone on your back. In each<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_225" id="PageI_225">[225]</a></span>
case, upon reaching the goal without dropping it, throw up and
catch it as it falls.</p>

<p>In the second plan (<a href="#Fig224">fig. 2</a>) the game is:&mdash;Throw stone into
No. 1. Pick it up. Hop, not touching lines, from No. 1 to
No. 4, and &#8220;out.&#8221; Throw stone into No. 2. Do as before.
And so successively into Nos. 3 and 4. Next balance stone on
shoe, then on the palm of hand, then on the back of hand,
then on the head, then on the shoulder, then on the eye (tilt
head back to keep it from falling). In each case walk round
once with it so balanced and catch at end.</p>

<p>In the third plan (<a href="#Fig224">fig. 3</a>) the game is:&mdash;Put pebble in No. 1.
Pick up. Hop, having one foot in No. 2 and the other in No. 3.
Step into No. 4. Hop, having one foot in No. 5 and the other
in No. 6. Jump round. Go back as you came. Then with
stone on shoe, walk through the figure, kick it up and catch at
the close. Place stone on eyelid; walk through the same figure,
dropping it off into hand at close. This is called &#8220;jumping.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the fourth plan (<a href="#Fig224">fig. 4</a>) the game is:&mdash;Throw stone into
No. 1. Pick it up. Hop from No. 1 to No. 8, not touching lines.
So successively into Nos. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. Walk into No. 1 with
stone on foot, and out at No. 8. Kick it up and catch it. The
same with stone on thumb. Toss it up and catch. Again with
stone on your back. Straighten up, let it slide into your hand.</p>

<p>In Stead&#8217;s <i>Holderness Glossary</i>, this is described as a boys&#8217; or
girls&#8217; game, in which the pavement is chalked with numbered
crossed lines, and a pebble or piece of crockery is propelled
onward by the foot, the performer hopping on one leg, the
number reached on the chalk-line being scored to him or her.
At Whitby it is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_16">Pally-ully</a>,&#8221; and played with rounded
pieces of pot the size of a penny. Divisions are chalked on the
pavement, and the &#8220;pally-ullies&#8221; are impelled within the lines
by a hop on one leg, and a side shuffle with the same foot
(<i>Whitby Glossary</i>). It is sometimes called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_229">Tray-Trip</a>.&#8221;
Atkinson describes the figure as oblong, with many angular
compartments (<i>Cleveland Glossary</i>). Jamieson defines &#8220;<a href="#GameI_37">Beds</a>&#8221;
as &#8220;Hop-scotch,&#8221; a game denominated from the form, sometimes
by strangers called squares. In Aberdeen the spaces
marked out are sometimes circular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_226" id="PageI_226">[226]</a></span>Mrs. Lincoln sends a diagram of the game from Dublin
(<a href="#Fig224">fig. 6</a>). Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) under the name of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_310">Hop-score</a>&#8221;
says it is a game in which certain squares are drawn or
<i>scored</i> on the ground. The piece of stone which is pushed
with the foot is called the &#8220;scotch.&#8221; Elworthy (<i>West Somerset
Words</i>) says a piece of tile is kicked over lines and into
squares marked on the ground. It is called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_282">Hickety-Hackety</a>,&#8221;
also &#8220;Huckety.&#8221; Cope (<i>Hampshire Glossary</i>) says it is played
in Hants. Moor (<i>Suffolk Words and Phrases</i>) describes this
game under the name of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_128">Scotch-hob</a>,&#8221; by hopping and kicking
a bit of tile from bed to bed of a diagram which he gives (<a href="#Fig224">fig. 5</a>,
here printed). Brockett (<i>North Country Words</i>) calls it &#8220;<a href="#GameI_37">Beds</a>.&#8221;
Barnes (<i>Dorset Glossary</i>) only says &#8220;hopping over a parallelogram
of scotches or chalk-lines on the ground.&#8221; F. H. Low, in
<i>Strand Magazine</i>, ii. 516, says the divisions are respectively
named onesie, twosie, threesie, foursie, and puddings. It is
called &#8220;Hop-bed&#8221; at Stixwold in Lincolnshire (Miss Peacock),
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_310">Hop-score</a>&#8221; in Yorkshire (Halliwell, l.c.), and &#8220;Hitchibed&#8221;
in Cleveland, Yorks. (<i>Glossary of Cleveland Words</i>). Strutt
describes it (<i>Sports</i>, p. 383); and Wood&#8217;s <i>Modern Playmate</i>,
p. 32, gives a diagram similar to one seen on a London pavement
by A. B. Gomme (see <a href="#Fig224">fig. 7</a>). Mr. Emslie has sent me
<a href="#Fig224">figs. 9 and 10</a>, also from London streets. Newell (<i>Games</i>,
p. 188) speaks of it as a well-known game in America.</p>

<p>Mr. Elworthy (<i>West Somerset Words</i>) says, &#8220;Several of
these (diagrams marked on the ground) are still to be seen,
scratched on the ancient pavement of the Roman Forum.&#8221;
Mr. J. W. Crombie says, &#8220;The game of &#8216;Hop-scotch&#8217; was one
of considerable antiquity, having been known in England for
more than two centuries, and it was played all over Europe
under different names. Signor Pitr&eacute;&#8217;s solar explanation of its
origin appeared improbable to him, for not only was the evidence
in its favour extremely weak, but it would require the original
number of divisions in the figure to have been twelve instead
of seven, which was the number indicated by a considerable
body of evidence. It would seem more probable that the game
at one time represented the progress of the soul from earth to
heaven through various intermediate states, the name given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_227" id="PageI_227">[227]</a></span>
the last court being most frequently paradise or an equivalent,
such as crown or glory, while the names of the other courts
corresponded with the eschatological ideas prevalent in the
early days of Christianity.&#8221; Some such game existed before
Christianity, and Mr. Crombie considered that it had been
derived from several ancient games. Possibly the strange
myths of the labyrinths might have had something to do with
&#8220;Hop-scotch,&#8221; and a variety of the game played in England,
under the name of &#8220;Round Hop-scotch,&#8221; was almost identical
with a game described by Pliny as being played by the boys
of his day. Mr. Crombie also said he &#8220;believed that the early
Christians adopted the general idea of the ancient game, but
they not only converted it into an allegory of heaven, with
Christian beliefs and Christian names; they Christianised the
figure also; they abandoned the heathen labyrinth and replaced
it by the form of the Basilicon, the early Christian church,
dividing it into seven parts, as they believed heaven to be
divided, and placing paradise, the inner sanctum of heaven,
in the position of the altar, the inner sanctum of their earthly
church.&#8221;</p>

<p>A game among children in which one of the company runs

out before him in resemblance of horns. The first person
whom he touches with his thumbs becomes his property, joins
hands with him, and aids in attempting to catch the rest: and

liberty still cry out, &#8220;Hornie, Hornie.&#8221;&mdash;Lothian (Jamieson).</p>

<p>Jamieson says: &#8220;Whether this play be a vestige of the very
ancient custom of assuming the appearance and skins of
animals, especially in the sports of Yule, or might be meant
to symbolise the exertions made by the devil (often called
&#8216;Hornie&#8217;) in making sinful man his prey, and employing<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_228" id="PageI_228">[228]</a></span>

<p>A game in which four play, a principal and an assistant on
each side. A. stands with his assistant at one hole, and throws
what is called a Cat (a piece of stick, and frequently a sheep&#8217;s
horn), with the design of making it alight in another hole at
some distance, at which B. and his assistant stand ready to
drive it aside. The bat or driver is a rod resembling a
walking-stick.</p>

back against a wall. Another boy bends his back as in &#8220;<a href="#GameI_385">Leapfrog</a>,&#8221;
and puts his head against the Stump. The cap of the
boy who bends down is then taken off, and put upon his back
upside down. Then each of the other boys who are playing
puts the first finger of his right hand into the cap. When all
the fingers are put into the cap, these lines are sung<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

next time, and so on.&mdash;S. O. Addy.</p>

<p>At Cork a handkerchief is tied over the eyes of one of the

hand on his back with the palm uppermost. Any of the party
come behind him and give him a slap on his hand, he in the
meantime trying to discover whose hand it is that strikes.&mdash;Miss
Keane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot Cockles&#8221; is an old game, practised especially at
Christmas. One boy sits down, and another, who is blindfolded,
kneels and lays his head on his knee, placing at the
same time his open hand on his own back. He then cries,
&#8220;Hot cockles, hot!&#8221; Another then strikes his open hand,
and the sitting boy asks who strikes. If the boy guessed
wrongly, he made a forfeit; but if rightly, he was released.&mdash;<i>Notes

<p>Nares&#8217; <i>Glossary</i> also contains quotations from works of 1639,
1653, and 1697 which illustrate the game. Mr. Addy says &#8220;that
this game as played in Sheffield is quite different from that described
under the same title in Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>. Aubrey
(p. 30) speaks of &#8216;Hot Cockles&#8217; as a game played at funerals
in Yorkshire, and the lines here given show that this was the

bird, and they remind one of the passing of the soul over
Whinny Moor (see funeral dirge in Aubrey&#8217;s <i>Remains of Gentilisme</i>,
p. 31). Grimm mentions the cuckoo hill (Gauchsberg).
He says, &#8216;Originally in Gauchsberg the bird himself may very
well have been meant in a mystic sense which has fallen dark
to us now&#8217; (<i>Teut. Myth.</i>, ii. 681). We know, too, the old
belief that the cuckoo tells children how many years they have
to live. These lines are also sometimes said, in addition to

<p>This game may have originated from a custom at funerals of
practising spells for the safe and speedy passage of the departing
spirit to its destination, or from divination mysteries to
foretell who would be the next among the mourners to follow
the dead body to the grave. The spirit of prophecy was
believed to exist in a dying person. See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_259">Handy Croopen</a>.&#8221;<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_48">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There are two methods of playing this game, one in
which a King and Queen are represented, and the other in
which gates of a city are represented. Of the first <a href="#BabylonChambers">Chambers</a>
and Mactaggart practically give the same account. The latter
says, &#8220;Two of the swiftest boys are placed between two &#8216;doons&#8217;
or places of safety; these, perhaps, are two hundred yards
distant. All the other boys stand in one of these places or
doons, when the two fleet youths come forward and address
them with the rhyme. When out, they run in hopes to get to
Babylon or the other doon, but many get not near that place
before they are caught by the runners, who &#8216;taens&#8217; them, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_236" id="PageI_236">[236]</a></span>
is, lay their hands upon their heads, when they are not allowed
to run any more in that game, that is, until they all be taened
or taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="#BabylonSporle">Norfolk game</a> seems to resemble the <a href="#BabylonNairn">Scotch</a>, though in
a much less complete form. Miss Matthews describes it as
follows:&mdash;&#8220;A line of children is formed, and the two standing
opposite it sing the questions, to which the line reply; then
the two start off running in any direction they please, and the
others try to catch them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second method of playing is best described by the Rev.
Walter Gregor, from the <a href="#BabylonNairn">Nairn game</a>, which is known as &#8220;The
Gates of Babylon.&#8221; Mr. Gregor writes as follows:&mdash;&#8220;This
game may be played either by boys or girls. Two of the
players join hands, and stand face to face, with their hands in
front as if forming a gate. Each of these has a secret name.
The other players form themselves into a line by clasping each
other round the waist from behind. They go up to the two
that form the gate, and the leader asks the first question, as in
version No. 2. The dialogue then proceeds to the end. The
two then lift their arms as high as they can, still joined, and
the line of players passes through. All at once the two bring
their arms down on one and make him (or her) prisoner. The
prisoner is asked in a whisper, so as not to disclose the secret
name, which of the two is to be chosen. The one so captured
takes his (or her) stand behind the one chosen. The same
process is gone through till all the players are taken captive,
and have stationed themselves behind the one or the other of
the two forming the gate. The last one of the line goes
through three times. The first time the word &#8216;breakfast&#8217; is
pronounced; the second time &#8216;dinner;&#8217; and the third time
&#8216;supper.&#8217; The player then chooses a side. The two sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_237" id="PageI_237">[237]</a></span>
have then a tug of war. The game ends at this point with girls.
With boys the conquered have to run the gauntlet. The
victors range themselves in two lines, each boy with his cap
or handkerchief tightly plaited in his hand, and pelt with all
their might the vanquished as they run between the lines.
The boys of Nairn call this running of the gauntlet, &#8216;through
fire an&#8217; watter.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig237" id="Fig237"></a>
<img src="images/illo1256.png" alt="Illustrations How Many Miles to Babylon" width="600" height="148" />
</div>

<p>The method of playing the <a href="#BabylonWarwick">Warwick</a>, <a href="#BabylonFernham">Fernham</a>, and <a href="#BabylonAnnaverna">Louth versions</a>
is practically the same. The children stand in half-circle
beginning with the two tallest at either end. All clasp hands.
The two at one end question those at the other end alternately
(<a href="#Fig237">fig. 1</a>). At the last line the two that have been answering
hold their hands up to form a bridge, and all the others thread
through, still holding hands (the bridge advancing slowly) (<a href="#Fig237">fig. 2</a>).
The <a href="#BabylonAnnaverna">Louth version</a> is also sometimes played as &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_10">Oranges
and Lemons</a>.&#8221; This is also the case with the <a href="#BabylonBelfast">Belfast</a>, <a href="#BabylonSShields">South
Shields</a>, <a href="#BabylonMDrayton">Ellesmere</a>, and <a href="#BabylonDublin">Dublin versions</a>. Miss Burne also
gives a second method of playing this game at <a href="#BabylonMDrayton">Ellesmere</a>: she
says, &#8220;The whole number of players stand in two rows facing
each other, each player joining hands with the one opposite.
The pair at the lower end parley with the pair at the top, and
then run under the extended arms of the others, receiving
thumps on the back as they go, till they reach the upper end,
and become the top couple in their turn.&#8221; The <a href="#BabylonHanbury">Hanbury version</a>
is played in a similar way. Two lines stand close together
holding handkerchiefs across. The questions are asked and
answered by the top and bottom players. Then two children
run under the line of handkerchiefs. The <a href="#BabylonDorsetshire">Dorset version</a> is
played by as many as like standing, two and two, opposite
each other, each of them taking with the right hand the right
hand of the other; then the two that are the King and Queen
say or sing the first question, to which the others reply,
and the dialogue ends in this manner. Then all the other
pairs hold up their hands as high as they can, and the King
and Queen run through the archway and back again, and so on
with the next pair, and other pairs in turn. The <a href="#BabylonMan">Isle of Man
version</a> is played, Mr. Moore says, the same as other &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_196">Thread
the Needle</a>&#8221; games.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_238" id="PageI_238">[238]</a></span>(<i>c</i>) The game is evidently dramatic in form, and perhaps is
illustrative of some fact of history, such as the toll upon merchandise
entering a walled town. The changes in the words
of the different versions are not very great, but they show the
influence of modern history upon the game. The appearance
of King George evidently points to the date when it was frequently
played, though the older versions are doubtless those
in which his Majesty does not do duty. Mactaggart has the
following quaint note which perhaps may supply the origin,
though it seems a far cry to the Crusaders:&mdash;&#8220;This sport
has something methinks of antiquity in it; it seemeth to be a
pantomime of some scenes played off in the time of the
Crusades. &#8216;King and Queen o&#8217; Cantilon&#8217; evidently must
be King and Queen of Caledon, but slightly changed by
time. Then Babylon in the rhyme, the way they had to
wander and hazard being caught by the infidels, all speak
as to the foundation of the game&#8221; (Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian
Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>).</p>

<p>In the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i> for December 1849, in a
review of the <i>Life of Shirley</i>, it is stated that in many parts of
England the old game of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_196">Thread the Needle</a>&#8221; is played to
the following words, which refer to the gate of the city of
Hebron, known as the &#8220;needle&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How many miles to Hebron?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Yes, and back again.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then thread the needle, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The game is also described in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, iv. 141, as
played in the same way as above, and the writer adds there
are subsequent evolutions by which each couple becomes in
succession the eye of the needle.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_318" id="GameI_318"></a>Howly</h3>

<p>A street game played by boys in a town, one of them hiding
behind a wall or house-end, and crying &#8220;Howly&#8221; to the
seekers.&mdash;Atkinson&#8217;s <i>Cleveland Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_319" id="GameI_319"></a>Huckie-buckie down the Brae</h3>

<p>Children in Lothian have a sport in which they slide down
a hill, sitting on their hunkers (Jamieson). The well-known
custom at Greenwich is probably the same game, and there are
examples at Tumbling Hill, a few miles from Exeter, at May
Pole Hill, near Gloucester, and other places.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_320" id="GameI_320"></a>Huckle-bones</h3>

<p>Holloway (<i>Dict. of Provincialisms</i>) says that the game is called
&#8220;Huckle-bones&#8221; in East Sussex and &#8220;<a href="#GameI_187">Dibs</a>&#8221; in West Sussex.
Parish (<i>Dict. of Sussex Dialect</i>) mentions that huckle-bones,
the small bone found in the joint of the knee of a sheep,
are used by children for playing the game of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_187">Dibs;</a>&#8221; also
Peacock&#8217;s <i>Manley and Corringham Glossary</i>. Barnes (<i>Dorset
Glossary</i>) says, &#8220;A game of toss and catch, played mostly by
two with five dibs or huckle-bones of a leg of mutton, or round
pieces of tile or slate.&#8221; Halliwell&#8217;s description is clearly wrong.
He says it was a game formerly played by throwing up the
hip-bone of some animal, on one side of which was a head of
Venus and on the other that of a dog. He who turned up the
former was the winner (<i>Dictionary</i>). Miss J. Barker writes
that &#8220;Huckle-bones&#8221; is played in Hexham; and Professor
Attwell (Barnes) played the game as a boy, and is still a proficient
in it; he played it recently for my benefit with his set of
real huckle-bones (A. B. Gomme); and see <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
9th ser., iv. 378, 379.</p>

<p>The figures or sets are practically the same as those described
under &#8220;<a href="#GameI_218">Fivestones</a>.&#8221; The game is very ancient. In
the <i>Sanctuarie of Salvation</i>, &amp;c., translated from the Latin of
Levinus Lemnius by Henry Kinder (8vo, London, printed by
H. Singleton), p. 144, we read, &#8220;These bones are called
&#8216;huckle-bones&#8217; or &#8216;coytes.&#8217;&#8221; For further information relating
to this game, as played by the ancients, the reader may consult
<i>Joannis Meursii Ludibunda, sive de Ludis Gr&aelig;corum, Liber
singularis</i> (8vo, Lugd. Bat. 1625), p. 7, and <i>Dan. Souterii
Palamedes</i>, p. 81; but more particularly, <i>I Tali ed altri
Strumenti lusori degli antichi Romani, discritti da Francesco
de &#8217;Ficoroni</i>, 4to, Rom. 1734. Against the suggestion
that the modern game is derived directly from the Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_240" id="PageI_240">[240]</a></span>
is the fact that it is known in countries never traversed or
occupied by the Romans. Thus Dr. Clarke, in his <i>Travels
in Russia</i>, 1810, p. 106, says: &#8220;In all the villages and towns
from Moscow to Woronetz, as in other parts of Russia, are
seen boys, girls, and sometimes even old men, playing with the
joint-bones of sheep. This game is called &#8216;<a href="#GameI_187">Dibbs</a>&#8217; by the
English. It is of very remote antiquity; for I have seen it
very beautifully represented on Grecian vases; particularly on
a vase in the collection of the late Sir William Hamilton,
where a female figure appeared most gracefully delineated
kneeling upon one knee, with her right arm extended, the
palm downwards, and the bones ranged along the back of her
hand and arm. In this manner the Russians play the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>The game otherwise called &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_139">Shinty</a>.&#8221; The shinty or hummie
is played by a set of boys in two divisions who attempt to drive
with curved sticks a ball, or what is more common, part of the
vertebral bone of a sheep, in opposite directions (<i>Blackwood&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, August 1821, p. 36). If one of the adverse party
happens to stand or run among his opponents, they call out
&#8220;Hummie, keep on your own side.&#8221;&mdash;Jamieson.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_322" id="GameI_322"></a>Hundreds</h3>

<p>A game at marbles, which is carried on until one of the
players scores 100 or some other high number agreed upon.
Any number can play, but it is best described for two players,
A. and B. First the players taw up to a hole; if both get in,
they repeat the process until one is left out, say B.; then A.
counts 10. Should both fail, the nearest goes first. He may now
lay his taw about the hole or fire at the other, on hitting which
he counts another 10. He now goes for the hole again, and
failing, lies where he happens to stop. If he misses, B. from
his present position tries to get into the hole, and failing, lies
still; but if he reaches the hole, he counts 10, and proceeds as
A. had done. The one who first gets the 100 (or other
number) now goes in for his &#8220;pizings,&#8221; which performance takes
place thus:&mdash;The loser, so far, is lying about, and the winner<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_241" id="PageI_241">[241]</a></span>
goes back to &#8220;drakes,&#8221; and again tries to lodge in the hole;
and if he succeeds, the game is up. If not, he lies still, and
the loser tries for the hole; if he gets in he counts another 10,
or if he should succeed in hitting the winner he scores his
adversary&#8217;s 100 to his own number, and then goes on for his
&#8220;pizings&#8221; as the other had done. In failure of either securing
the game thus, the process is repeated at &#8220;drakes.&#8221; When,
however, the one who is on for his &#8220;pizings&#8221; manages to taw
into the hole, the game is concluded.&mdash;Easther&#8217;s <i>Almondbury
and Huddersfield Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_323" id="GameI_323"></a>Hunt the Hare</h3>

<p>A game among children, played on the ice as well as in the
fields (Brockett&#8217;s <i>North Country Words</i>). Strutt (<i>Sports</i>, p.
381) says &#8220;Hunt the Hare&#8221; is the same game as &#8220;Hunt the
Fox.&#8221; In this game one boy is permitted to run out, and
having law given to him&mdash;that is, being permitted to go to a
certain distance from his comrades before they pursue him&mdash;their
object is to take him, if possible, before he can return home.</p>

</div>

<p>All the players but one sit on the floor in a circle with their
legs crossed (Turkish fashion), one acting as Chief, all pretending
to work at making or mending shoes. The other player
brings a slipper to the Chief Cobbler, and desires it to be
mended, saying<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get it done by half-past two.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The child walks away, and returns in a few moments and
asks whether the shoe is ready. The Cobbler says, &#8220;Not
quite; call again in an hour&#8217;s time,&#8221; or makes any other excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_242" id="PageI_242">[242]</a></span>
which occurs to him. When the child calls again, she is told
it has been sent home. After several pretences the child
declares an intention to search for it. The Cobblers in the
ring then all place their hands under their knees, and pass the
slipper secretly from one to another in such a way as to prevent
the owner of the shoe getting it for some time. The
Cobbler from whom the slipper is taken becomes the owner
next time (Barnes, A. B. Gomme). In the Nottinghamshire
version (Miss Peacock) the rhyme is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give it a stitch and that will do.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Versions from Wakefield, Liphook, Ellesmere, and other
places are practically the same as the Barnes game, but Mr.
Udal gives an elaboration of the Dorsetshire game in the <i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, vii. 238. One Lancashire version (Miss Dendy)
reverses the characters by making the Cobbler run round the
ring, and the children requiring the shoe to be mended, call out,
&#8220;Blackie, come mend my slipper.&#8221; Mrs. Harley, in another
Lancashire version, gives the words sung to the tune printed as<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pass on, pass on, passy on the slipper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best fun we ever had was passing on the slipper.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Holloway (<i>Dict. of Provincialisms</i>) says this game was well
known in Somerset, Hants, Sussex, but now is almost out of
fashion. He describes it as being played without words. The
child who has to find the shoe stands in the centre of the
circle. The chief amusement arises from the one in the circle
who has the slipper striking the one who stands up (the
searcher) while he or she is steadily looking for it in an opposite
direction. Strutt (<i>Sports</i>, p. 387) also describes this game.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_77">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_325" id="GameI_325"></a>Hunt the Staigie</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game. One is chosen to be the Staigie (little

The Staigie locks his fingers into each other. He
then repeats the words<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

the players. He must not unlock his hands till he has caught
one. When he has captured one, the two join hands and hunt
for another. When another is caught, he joins the two. This
goes on till all are hunted down.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The players march two by two, all singing. The first
pair let go hands, separate, and skip widely apart, still singing.
Gradually, in this manner, two separate lines are formed, until,
following each other and singing, the pairs come together again,
join hands, and march and sing in couplets linked.</p>

<p>The <a href="#HuntingBath">Bath game</a> is played by the children standing in two
rows facing each other, and clapping hands and singing the verse.
At the same time the two children facing each other at the top
of the lines join hands and trip down and up between the
lines. Their hands are unclasped, and the two children run
down the outside of the lines, one running on each side, and
meet at the bottom of the lines, where they stand. The two
children now standing at the top proceed in the same way:
this is continued until all the children have done the same.
A ring is then formed, when the children again clap and sing.
Any number can play at this game.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#HuntingEpworth">Epworth version</a> the children range themselves in
double rank at one end of the room or playground, and march
down to the other end hand in hand. At the bottom they loose
hands and divide, the first rank turning right, the second left,
and march back in two single files to the other end again,
where they re-form as at first, and repeat their man&oelig;uvre,
singing the verses alternately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_245" id="PageI_245">[245]</a></span>The <a href="#HuntingLincoln">Lincolnshire game</a> is played by the children walking
two and two in a circle round one of their companions, singing.
The players then stand facing the child in the centre, and
place their hands on their partners&#8217; shoulders. After the lines
are sung the centre child cries out, &#8220;Halt! Shoulder arms!
Fire!&#8221; at which words each child kisses his partner. If the
commander sees any one hesitate, or avoid kissing, he runs
forward and takes the defaulter&#8217;s place, leaving him to fill the
middle position.</p>

<p>Similar versions are played at Earls Heaton (Mr. Hardy),
Forest of Dean (Miss Matthews), Ellesmere (Burne, <i>Shropshire
Folk-lore</i>, p. 574), Derbyshire (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, i.
386).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_327" id="GameI_327"></a>Hurling</h3>

<p>A game played with a ball. The players are divided into
two equal parties, each of which tries to secure and keep
the ball in their possession. The prize is a ball made of
cork, covered with silver.&mdash;Courtney&#8217;s <i>West Cornwall Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>In Taylor&#8217;s <i>Antiquitates Curios&aelig;</i>, p. 144, it is stated:&mdash;&#8220;The
game of hurling consisted in throwing or hurling a ball of wood
about three inches in diameter, and covered with plated silver,
sometimes gilt. On the ball was frequently a Cornish motto
allusive to the game, and signifying that fair play was best.
Success depended on catching the ball dexterously when dealt,
and conveying it away through all the opposition of the adverse
party, or, if that was impossible, to throw it into the hands of
a partner, who, in his turn, was to exert his utmost efforts to
convey it to his own goal, which was often three or four miles
distant from that of his adversaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>T. Durfey&#8217;s <i>Collin&#8217;s Walk through London</i>, 1690, p. 192, says:
&#8220;Hurling is an ancient sport us&#8217;d to this day in the countys
of Cornwall and Devon, when once a year the hardy young
fellows of each county meet; and a cork ball thinly plated
with silver being thrown up between &#8217;em, they run, bustle, and
fight for it, to the witty dislocating of many a shrew&#8217;d neck, or
for the sport of telling how bravely their arms or legs came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_246" id="PageI_246">[246]</a></span>
be broke, when they got home.&#8221; It is fully described by
Carew in his <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>, 1602, p. 73.</p>

<p>It is also a very ancient Irish game, and Mr. Kinahan says:
&#8220;Many places are called after it: such as, Killahurla, the hurlers&#8217;
church; Gortnahurla, the field of the hurlers; Greenanahurla,
the sunny place of the hurlers; this, however, is now generally
corrupted into hurling-green. The hurling-green where the
famous match was played by the people of Wexford against
those of Cather (now divided into the counties of Carlow and
Wicklow), and where the former got the name of yellow bellies,
from the colour of the scarfs they wore round their waist, is a
sunny flat on the western side of North Wicklow Gap, on the
road from Gorey to Trinnahely. There are also many other different
names that record the game.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, ii. 266.</p>

played in some parts of Devon and Somerset. A hole of some
extent was made in an uneven piece of ground, and the game

by a ceremony of no very delicate description, which
sufficed to render the fallen marble still more ignominious.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s

<p class="source">&mdash;North Derbyshire (S. O. Addy).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the <a href="#NewburyGame">Enborne, Newbury, version</a> (Miss Kimber) a
ring is formed by the children (boys and girls) joining
hands. Another child stands in the centre. The ring of
children walk round while singing the verses. The singing
is confined to the ring. When the centre child is told to
&#8220;choose,&#8221; she selects a boy from the ring, who goes into the
centre and they stand together. At the next verse these two
children walk out of the ring arm-in-arm. When the next
verse is sung they return, and again stand in the centre. At
the next verse the boy pretends to put a ring on the girl&#8217;s
finger. They walk out of the ring when told to go to church
(two children in the ring unclasping hands to let them walk
out, and again clasping hands after they return), and kiss each
other and shake hands when the two next verses are sung.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_255" id="PageI_255">[255]</a></span>
The child who was first in the centre then joins the ring, and
the game proceeds in the same way with the second child, who
chooses in his turn. All the other versions follow the same
rules, suiting their actions to the words, except <a href="#OgbourneGame">Ogbourne,
Wilts</a>, in which the two children in the centre sing the verse,
&#8220;roast beef and plum pudding.&#8221; They stand face to face, take
hold of each other&#8217;s hands, and sway their arms from side to
side. The ring then sing the concluding verse. In those
versions where &#8220;say your prayers&#8221; and &#8220;kneel down&#8221; occur,
the two centre children kneel, and hold their open hands together
in front of them to imitate a book. In the <a href="#LondonGame">London
version</a> (A. B. Gomme) a handkerchief was laid on the ground,
and the two children stood on each side of it and clasped
hands across it. In the <a href="#FernhamGame">Fernham and Longcot version</a> the
one child leads the other out of the ring at &#8220;go to church,&#8221;
with a graceful half-dancing motion, and back again in the
same way. The first child joins the ring while the refrain is
sung. In the <a href="#HanburyGame">Hanbury version</a> the centre child pretends to be
weeping; another child stands outside the ring and goes into
it; when the two meet they kiss. In the <a href="#DerbyshireGame">North Derbyshire
version</a> (Mr. S. O. Addy) a ring is formed of young men
and women, a young man being in the centre. He chooses
a young woman at the singing of the fifth line, and then joins
the ring, the girl remaining in the centre.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The tunes of all versions are very similar. The tune of
the <a href="#NewburyGame">Newbury game</a> (Miss Kimber) is the same as the <i>first</i> part
of the <a href="#OgbourneSong">Ogbourne tune</a> printed (Mr. H. S. May); that from
<a href="#NottinghamGame">Nottingham</a> (Miss Youngman) is the same as the first part
of the <a href="#LondonSong">London version</a>. This is also the case with the <a href="#HanburyGame">Hanbury,
Staffs.</a> (Miss E. Hollis) and <a href="#FernhamGame">Fernham and Longcot game</a>.
What difference there is is very slight. The <a href="#WrothamGame">Platt, Kent, game</a>
(Miss Burne), is sung to the same tune as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_251">Green Gravel</a>,&#8221;
given <i>ante</i>, p. 170. The <i>first</i> portion only of the tune is repeated
for all verses sung after the first verse. The Barnes game
is sung to the same tune as the <a href="#EarlsHeatonSong">Earls Heaton</a> (Mr. Hardy), which
is printed <i>ante</i>. A version played at Barnes is almost identical
with the <a href="#SouthamptonGame">Southampton version</a>, and another collected by Miss
Thoyts in Berkshire (<i>Antiquary</i>, vol. xxvii. p. 193) is similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_256" id="PageI_256">[256]</a></span>
to the <a href="#HanburyGame">Hanbury version</a>. The first lines run&mdash;Choose your
lover; Open the gates; Go to church, love; Kneel down, love;
Say your prayers, love; Put on the ring; Stand up, love; In
the ring, love; Kiss together, love.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The words of all the versions are sufficiently similar to
analyse without a special form. The game appears to be
purely a love and marriage game, and has probably had its
origin in a ballad, and this idea is strengthened by the fact
that only one version (<a href="#LondonGame">London</a>) has the marriage formula sung
at the end, and this is probably an arbitrary addition. The
lover is represented as lonely and disconsolate, and the remedy
suggested is to choose a sweetheart. The marriage ceremony
is of the simplest description&mdash;the clasping of hands and the
kissing within the circle probably implying the betrothal at a
spot sacred to such functions, similar to the Standing Stones
of Stenness. Whatever may have been the original intention
of these stones, they came in more recent times to be the
resort of lovers, who joined their right hands through the
hole in the altar stones in the belief that this ceremony
would add additional solemnity to the betrothal. Miss
Gordon Cumming, in her <i>Tour in the Hebrides</i>, mentions the
fact of the marriage ceremony being of the simplest&mdash;a man
and woman standing facing each other and clasping hands
over a particular stone. Walking arm-in-arm is a sign in
Dorsetshire that a couple are married. The mention of the
&#8220;roast beef and plum pudding&#8221; for dinner has probably had
its origin in the wedding dinner or breakfast, and the inviting
of friends to assemble for the wedding dinner. The word
&#8220;Isabella&#8221; may have been originally something quite different
from the name of a girl. I am inclined to think the word
was not the name of a person at all; possibly it was something
addressed to a particular person in words the sense of
which are now lost, and the nearest idea to it was this name.
The same thing may also apply to the word &#8220;farewell,&#8221; and
hence the incongruity of the first few lines in nearly all versions.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_49">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay a forfeit.
As the spill is getting burnt out the lines are said very quickly,
as everybody is anxious not to have to pay the forfeit.&mdash;Addy&#8217;s

<p>At Egan, in Derbyshire, a number of persons sit round a

<p>If the ember or lighted stick goes out whilst any one is twirling
it round, and whilst the lines are being said, he has to lie on
the floor, when stones, chairs, or other articles of furniture are
piled upon him.&mdash;S. O. Addy.</p>

<p>Mactaggart calls it &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_64">Preest Cat</a>,&#8221; and says that it is an

<p>Then round is handed the stick, and whomsoever&#8217;s hand it
goes out in, that one is in a wad, and must kiss the crook,
the cleps, and what not, ere he gets out of it.</p>

wailing began in the country side, as it was thought it became
some supernatural being&mdash;a witch, perhaps, of hideous form&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_258" id="PageI_258">[258]</a></span>
to keep it alive was a great matter.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian

<p>He also refers to a game called &#8220;Robin-a-Ree,&#8221; much like
&#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_64">Preest Cat</a>,&#8221; only in passing the burnt stick round the ring the

<p>Robin-a-Ree occurs in an old song.&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian

<p>In Cornwall it is known as &#8220;Robin&#8217;s a-light,&#8221; and is played
around the fire. A piece of stick is set on fire and whirled
around rapidly in the hand of the first player, who says,
&#8220;Robin&#8217;s a-light, and if he go out I will saddle your back.&#8221; It
is then passed to the next, who says the same thing, and so
on. The person who lets the spark die out has to pay a forfeit.&mdash;Scilly
(Courtney&#8217;s West <i>Cornwall Glossary</i>). A rhyme
at Lostwithiel is known as follows<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Jamieson (<i>Dictionary</i>) says, &#8220;To do &#8216;Dingle-dousie,&#8217; a stick
is ignited at one end and given as a plaything to a child.&#8221;
Elworthy (<i>West Somerset Words</i>) does not give this as a
game, but says a burning stick was whirled round and round
very quickly, so as to keep up the appearance of a ribbon
of fire. Miss Burne (<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 530), says,
&#8220;Children wave a burning stick in the air, saying<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

miniature to the old tribal custom of carrying the fiery cross to
rouse the clans at once suggests the possible origin of it. The
detention of the fiery cross through neglect or other impediment
was regarded with much dread by the inhabitants of the
place in which it should occur. This subject is discussed in
<i>Gomme&#8217;s Primitive Folkmoots</i>, p. 279 <i>et seq.</i><span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_21">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>These lines are chanted by players that stand thus. One places
his back against a wall, tree, &amp;c., grasping another, whose back
is toward him, round the waist; the second grasps a third, and
so on. The player called Jack walks apart until the conclusion
of the lines. Then he goes to the others and pokes at or pats
them, saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re done yet,&#8221; and walks away
again. The chant is repeated, and when he is satisfied that
the bread is &#8220;done&#8221; he endeavours to pull the foremost from
the grasp of the others, &amp;c.&mdash;Warwickshire (Northall&#8217;s <i>Folk

<p>A game among school-girls, played with small pebbles, and
sometimes with plum or cherry stones (Dickinson&#8217;s <i>Cumberland

called Jackstones,&#8221; says Mr. Patterson (<i>Antrim and Down
Glossary</i>). The game is called &#8220;Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Two children stand apart; one, who personates the
Mother, stands still and holds out her skirts with both hands;
the other personates Jenny Jones, and kneels or stoops down
in a crouching position behind her companion&#8217;s outstretched
skirts. The other players form a line by joining hands. They
sing the first, third, and every alternate verse, advancing and
retiring in line while doing so. The Mother sings the answers
to their questions, standing still and hiding Jenny Jones all the
time from view. When the verses are finished, Jenny Jones
lies down as if she were dead, and the Mother stands aside.
Two of the other players then take up Jenny Jones, one by
the shoulders and the other by the feet, and carry her a little
distance off, where they lay her on the ground. All the players
follow, generally two by two, with their handkerchiefs at their
eyes and heads lowered, pretending to grieve.</p>

<p>This is the more general way of playing the game. In those
versions where the reply, &#8220;Very well, ladies,&#8221; occurs, this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_278" id="PageI_278">[278]</a></span>
sung by the line of children just before they sing, &#8220;We&#8217;ve come
to see Jenny Jones.&#8221; Sometimes, as in the <a href="#JennyBerrington">Berrington and
Chirbury game</a>, two lines of children facing each other advance
and retire, singing the verses. They then carry Jenny Jones to
a corner, lay her down, stand in a circle round, and sing to her
the last verse. In the Hants versions sent by Miss Mendham,
six or eight children carry Jenny stretched out and flat,
lay her down, cover her over, and then sing the last lines.
The rest of the children follow them. In the <a href="#JennyBelfast">Irish (Belfast)
version</a> the game is played in the same way; the funeral is
arranged, when Jenny suddenly comes to life again (W. H.
Patterson). In the <a href="#JennySouthampton">Southampton version</a>, after the carrying of
Jenny by her head and feet to the grave, and the other children
following and standing round, Jenny Jones rises up and pursues
the children. She is called the Ghost. The children run
away in affected terror, calling out, &#8220;The Ghost!&#8221; Whoever
she catches becomes Jenny Jones in the next game. This
incident is also played in the Barnes, <a href="#JennyNorthants">Northants</a>, <a href="#JennyLouth">Annaverna,
co. Louth</a>, <a href="#JennyEnborne">Enborne</a> and <a href="#JennyLiphook">Liphook</a> versions.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is played very generally throughout the
country, and I have other versions collected from Earls Heaton
(Mr. H. Hardy), Barnes (A. B. Gomme), Cambridge (Mrs.
Haddon), Hampshire (Miss Mendham), Frodingham (Miss Peacock),
Cowes, Isle of Wight (Miss E. Smith), Sulhampstead,
Berks (Miss Thoyts), and Platt, Kent (Miss Burne). These
versions are so similar to the <a href="#JennyHanwell">Hanwell version</a>, with the exception
of the &#8220;Very well, ladies,&#8221; that it is needless to print
them in full; special differences are noted hereafter. In some
places the game is said in a sing-song manner.</p>

<p>Some of the versions differ from the general type in two
ways&mdash;first, in the method of playing; secondly, in the wording
of the verses. The differences in the method of playing direct
attention to the connection of the game with ancient custom.
The game is always played by the players taking sides; but
one method is for one side to consist of only two children
(Mother and Jenny Jones), and the other side to consist of all
the other players; while the other method is for the players to
be divided into two sides of about equal numbers, each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_279" id="PageI_279">[279]</a></span>
advancing and retiring in line when singing their part. Jenny
Jones in some cases walks with the girls in her line until the
funeral, when she is carried to the grave, and in others she
stands alone behind the line. The way of performing the
funeral also differs. Generally two of the players carry Jenny
to the grave, the rest following two by two; but in one Hampshire
version six or eight children carry Jenny, stretched out
and flat, to the grave, and cover her over; in <a href="#JennyHolywood">Holywood, co.
Down</a>, she is carried sitting on the crossed hands of two
players; while in some versions no funeral is apparently
performed, the words only being sung. Another significant
incident is the Ghost. An additional incident occurs in the
<a href="#JennyLiphook">Liphook version</a>, which represents her being &#8220;swung to life
again&#8221; by two of the players.</p>

<p>These differences may perhaps be immaterial to the meaning
and origin of the game, but they are sufficiently indicative of
early custom to suggest the divergence of the game in modern
times towards modern custom. Thus the players divided line-by-line
follow the general form for children playing singing
games, and it would therefore suggest itself as the earlier form
for this game. The change of the game from the line-by-line
action to the mother-and-line action would indicate a corresponding
change in the prevailing custom which influenced the
game. This custom was the wooing by a band of suitors of
girls surrounded by their fellow-villagers, which became obsolete
in favour of ordinary marriage custom. The dropping out
of this custom would cause the game to change from a representation
of both wooing and burial to one of burial only. As
burial only the mother-and-line action is sufficient, but the
presence of a wooing incident in the earlier form of the game
is plainly revealed by the verse which sings, &#8220;Fare ye well,
ladies,&#8221; or, as it has become in the English variant, &#8220;Very
well, ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The difference in the wording of the versions is slight,
and does not need formal analysis. Domestic occupation is
shown throughout, washing and its attendants, drying, folding,
starching and ironing being by far the most numerous, brewing,
and baking only occurring in one. Illness, dying, and death<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_280" id="PageI_280">[280]</a></span>
are the usual forms for the later verses, but illness and dying
are lost in several versions. The choosing of colours is in
some versions not for the mourners but for the dead maiden,
and in these cases (six) white is the colour chosen, for &#8220;white&#8217;s
what the dead wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>This question of colours for the dead is a very important
one. The dressing of the dead body of a maiden in white
by her girl companions, and the carrying of the body by them
to the grave, are known village customs, the whole village being
invited to the funeral. The rising of the dead lover, and the
belief that excessive mourning over a loved one disturbs his or
her rest in the grave, thus causing the dead to rise and speak,
are shown in old ballads; the belief that spirits of the dead
haunt churchyards and places of their former abode may also
be adduced in illustration of the ghost incident.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The methods of playing, and the incidents revealed by
the verses sung, show that this is perhaps the most realistic
of all the singing games, the daily occupation, the illness,
death, and burial being portrayed, first, in the words of the
rhymes, and secondly, by the accompanying action. The
Scottish versions make the opening incident that of a lover
coming to the house of the loved one, then proceed to the
domestic occupation, and finally to the death incident; while
the English versions give the idea of village friends calling
upon a favourite companion, and subsequently attending her
funeral. That the former is the older of the two versions is
confirmed by the great probability of the name &#8220;Jenny Jones&#8221;
being a degraded form of &#8220;Janet jo.&#8221; There is some evidence
for this. The <a href="#JennySporle">Sporle version</a> gives it as &#8220;Jenny Joe,&#8221; which is
clearly a misunderstood rendering of &#8220;Jenny jo.&#8221; The corruption
of this into &#8220;Jenny Jones&#8221; is exactly what might be
expected from modern English ignorance of the pretty meaning
of the word jo, &#8220;dear;&#8221; and to what lengths this corruption
may proceed under such influences may be seen by versions
from Earls Heaton, where we have &#8220;Jingy Jog;&#8221; Leeds, where
we get &#8220;Jilly Jog;&#8221; and the Edinburgh version, where we have
&#8220;Georgina.&#8221;</p>

<p>This would be an argument for the Scottish home of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_281" id="PageI_281">[281]</a></span>
rhymes, and for the direct borrowing of the name from Scotland
by the English villagers. In furtherance of this view the
following passage from Chambers may be quoted:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, &#8220;Janet Jo&#8221; is a dramatic
entertainment amongst young rustics. Suppose a party has
met in a harvest or winter evening round a good peat fire,
and it is resolved to have &#8220;Janet Jo&#8221; performed. Two undertake
to personate a goodman and a goodwife; the rest a family
of marriageable daughters. One of the lads, the best singer
of the party, retires, and equips himself in a dress proper for
representing an old bachelor in search of a wife. He comes
in, bonnet in hand, bowing, and sings<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The suitor then advances gaily to his sweetheart, and the

<p>On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that this game-drama
and the game of &#8220;Janet Jo&#8221; have no connection beyond
the name of the heroine and the wooing incident; so that the
borrowing, if borrowing there be, might have been by Scotland,
who improved the commonplace &#8220;Jenny Jones&#8221; into the
pretty sweetness of her Scottish namesake. The Scottish version
of the game leaves out the question of the colours for
mourning, but, on the other hand, it contains the very important
incident of the restoration of the dead. Chambers (<i>Popular
Rhymes</i>, p. 141) suggests that this incident was introduced
for the purpose of beginning the game again, but this seems
extremely doubtful, in consideration of the <a href="#JennyLiphook">Liphook variant</a>,
in which Miss Fowler says, &#8220;It is no uncommon thing for
&#8216;Jenny Jones&#8217; to be swung into life again;&#8221; and the still
more significant <a href="#JennySouthampton">Southampton version</a>, where &#8220;&#8216;Jenny Jones&#8217;
appears in the character of the Ghost, and scatters and pursues
the surrounding mourners.&#8221; This detail is also used by the
<a href="#JennyNorthants">Northants</a> and Barnes children, the version of whose game is
very like the <a href="#JennySouthampton">Southampton</a> one. On the whole, the analysis
would suggest that there has been a game played by the children
of both England and Scotland, the leading incidents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_283" id="PageI_283">[283]</a></span>
which have been varied in accordance with the conditions of
life. Mr. Napier (<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, iv. 474), in his description
of the <a href="#JennyWScotland">West Scotland example</a>, evidently considered the game
to be thoroughly representative of Scottish life, and this,
indeed, seems to be the most striking feature of the game in
all the variants. The domestic economy which they reveal is
in no case out of keeping with the known facts of everyday
peasant life, and many a mother has denied to her child&#8217;s
friends the companionship they desired because of the work to
be done.</p>

<p>In most cases the burden of the song rests upon the question
of health, but in two cases, namely, <a href="#JennyColchester">Colchester</a> and <a href="#JennyDeptford">Deptford</a>,
the question is put as to where &#8220;Jenny Jones&#8221; is at the
time of the visit. It is curious that the refrain of &#8220;Farewell,
ladies,&#8221; should appear in such widely separated districts
as Scotland, Northamptonshire, Norfolk, Middlesex, Hants,
Lincoln, and Barnes.</p>

<p>With reference to the colours for mourning, there is an
obvious addition of crape introduced into the <a href="#JennyDeptford">Deptford version</a>
which is very suggestive of the decadence going on. The
four colours used in most versions are red, blue, white, and
black, colours which have been known to the people from
ancient times. Black is accepted as the correct colour in all
versions except five, where white is declared to be the colour
which the dead wear. The method of question and answer is
adopted for all the rhyme-movements. The tune of the game,
with but slight variation, in all the versions is the same as that
given from <a href="#JennyPlattSong">Platt</a>, near Wrotham, except the two which are
printed from <a href="#JennyNorthantsSong">Northants</a> and <a href="#JennyBelfastSong">Belfast</a>.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_50">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There must be an odd number of players at this game.
They form into couples, each standing behind the other, making
a ring, the girls inside, one boy standing alone in the middle.
As they go round they sing the verse. At the end each boy
leaves hold of his partner&#8217;s arm and catches the arm of the
girl in front, the one who is standing in the centre trying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_286" id="PageI_286">[286]</a></span>
the confusion to get into a place. If he succeeds, the child left
out has to be the one in the centre the next time.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Mr. Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 101) says this game was called
the &#8220;Baptist Game&#8221; in Virginia, where it is said to be enjoyed
by pious people who will not dance. The American game is
played in the same way as the English one. Mr. Newell gives
the tune to which the game was sung. The words are almost
identical. This game is played in the same way as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_351">Jolly

<p>While the words are being repeated all the players are putting
themselves on the alert, and when they are finished they run
off in all directions, with Rover in full pursuit. If a player
is hard pressed he has the privilege of running to &#8220;Parley,&#8221;
the place from which the players started, and which in all
games is an asylum. If he is caught before he reaches it, he
becomes Johnny Rover for the next game. The one first
captured becomes Rover.&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A circle is formed by joining hands, and two children
stand in the centre. They walk round. At the seventh line
the two in the centre each choose one child from the ring, thus
making four in the centre. They then sing the remaining four
lines. The two who were first in the centre then go out,
and the game begins again, with the other two players in the
centre.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game requires an uneven number of players. All
the children except one stand in couples arm in arm, each
couple closely following the other. This forms a double ring or
wheel (<a href="#Fig291">fig. 1</a>). The odd child stands in the centre. The children
forming the wheel walk round in a circle and sing the verse.
When they come to the word &#8220;grab,&#8221; those children standing
on the <i>inside</i> of the wheel leave hold of their partners&#8217; arms,
and try to catch hold of the one standing immediately in front
of their previous partners. The child in the centre (or Miller)
tries (while they are changing places) to secure a partner and
place (<a href="#Fig291">fig. 2</a>). If he succeeds in doing this, the one then left out
becomes the Miller. At Leicester the &#8220;odd&#8221; child, or &#8220;miller,&#8221;
stands <i>outside</i> the wheel or ring, instead of being in the centre,
and it is the outside children who change places. Mr. Addy,
in the Sheffield version, says, &#8220;The young men stand in the
outer ring, and the young women in the inner. A man stands
within the inner circle, quite near to it. The men try and grasp
the arm of the girl in front of them, and the man in the centre
also tries to grasp one; the man he displaces taking his place
as Miller. Then the three last lines are sung.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Hopper&#8221; has first become &#8220;upper,&#8221; and then &#8220;other.&#8221; Of
the <a href="#MillerPotteries">North Staffs. Potteries version</a> Miss Keary says, &#8220;How it
ends I have never been able to make out; no one about here
seems to know either.&#8221; With the exception of these few
variants, it is singular how stereotyped the words of the rhyme
have become in this game.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game may owe its origin to the fact of the miller
in olden times paying himself in kind from the corn brought
to him to be ground. The miller is a well-known object of
satire in old ballads and mediaeval writers. It is, however,
probable that the custom which formerly prevailed at some of
the public festivals, of catching or &#8220;grabbing&#8221; for sweethearts
and wives, is shown in this game. For instance, to
account for a Scottish custom it is said that St. Cowie, patron
saint of two parishes of Campbeltown, proposed that all who
did not find themselves happy and contented in the marriage
state, should be indulged with an opportunity of parting and
making a second choice. For that purpose he instituted an
annual solemnity, at which all the unhappy couples in his
parish were to assemble at his church; and at midnight all
present were blindfolded and ordered to run round the church
at full speed, with a view of mixing the lots in the urn. The
moment the ceremony was over, without allowing an instant
for the people present to recover from their confusion, the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_293" id="PageI_293">[293]</a></span>
&#8220;Cabbay&#8221; (seize quickly) was pronounced, upon which every
man laid hold of the first female he met with. Whether old
or young, handsome or ugly, good or bad, she was his wife till
the next anniversary of this custom (Guthrie&#8217;s <i>Scottish Customs</i>,
p. 168). Another old wedding superstition is alluded to by
Longfellow:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_296" id="PageI_296">[296]</a></span>(<i>b</i>) This game is played at Warwick as follows:&mdash;The children
form a large ring, clasping hands and standing still.
One child walks round inside the ring, singing the verses.
This child then chooses another from the ring, bending on one
knee and kissing her hand. The lines are then repeated, the
two walking arm in arm round the inside of the ring. Another
child is chosen out of the ring by the one who was chosen
previously. This goes on until all are chosen out of the ring,
walking two by two round inside. When the ring will no
longer hold them, the two walk round outside. At Northants
the ring walks round, and the child is <i>outside</i> the ring.
Partners are chosen, and the two walk round outside the ring.
The first two walk together till there is a third, then the three
walk together till there is a fourth, then they go in couples.
In the Northants version, from Raunds, four boys stand in the
centre of the ring. When the verses are sung they choose
four girls, and then take their places in the ring. The four
girls then choose four lads, and so on. At Earls Heaton the
children stand against a wall in a line. Another child walks
up and down singing the verses, and chooses a partner. He
spreads a handkerchief on the ground, and they kneel and
kiss.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Shipley version is a &#8220;<a href="#GameI_368">Kiss in the Ring</a>&#8221; game.
A version sent by the Rev. W. Slater Sykes from Settle,
Yorkshire, is almost identical with the <a href="#JollySailorsEH">Earls Heaton version</a>.
Northall (<i>Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 369) says &#8220;to kiss on the floor&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
not in secret. He gives the words of a sort of
musical catch, sung in the Midlands, similar in character to
this game, which may once have been used in some courting
game. Mr. Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 124) gives a version sung in
the streets of New York, and considers it to be a relic of
antiquity, a similar round being given in <i>Deuteromelia</i>, 1609.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_52">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_356" id="GameI_356"></a>Keeling the Pot</h3>

<p>Brockett mentions that a friend informed him that he had
seen a game played amongst children in Northumberland the
subject of which was &#8220;Keeling the Pot.&#8221; A girl comes in
exclaiming, &#8220;Mother, mother, the pot&#8217;s boiling ower.&#8221; The
answer is, &#8220;Then get the ladle and keel it.&#8221; The difficulty is
to get the ladle, which is &#8220;up a height,&#8221; and the &#8220;steul&#8221; wants
a leg, and the joiner is either sick or dead (<i>Glossary North
Country Words</i>). A sentence from <i>Love&#8217;s Labours Lost</i>,
&#8220;While greasy Joan doth keel the pot,&#8221; illustrates the use of
the term &#8220;keel.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_357" id="GameI_357"></a>Keppy Ball</h3>

<p>In former times it was customary every year, at Easter and
Whitsuntide, for the mayor, aldermen, and sheriff of Newcastle,
attended by the burgesses, to go in state to a place called the
Forth, a sort of mall, to countenance, if not to join in the
play of &#8220;Keppy ba&#8221; and other sports. This diversion is still
in part kept up by the young people of the town (Brockett&#8217;s
<i>North Country Words</i>). It is also mentioned in Peacock&#8217;s
<i>Manley and Corringham Glossary</i>, and in Ross and Stead&#8217;s
<i>Holderness Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Tate (<i>History of Alnwick</i>) says that a favourite pastime
of girls, &#8220;Keppy ball,&#8221; deserves a passing notice, because accompanied
by a peculiar local song. The name indicates the
character of the game; &#8220;kep&#8221; is from <i>cepan</i>, Anglo-Saxon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_298" id="PageI_298">[298]</a></span>
&#8220;kappan,&#8221; Teut., &#8220;to catch or capture;&#8221; for when the game
was played at by several, the ball was thrown into the air and
&#8220;kepped,&#8221; or intercepted, in its descent by one or other of the
girls, and it was then thrown up again to be caught by some
other. But when the song was sung it was played out by one
girl, who sent the ball against a tree and drove it back again as
often as she could, saying the following rhymes, in order to
divine her matrimonial future:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Come down the long loanin&#8217; and tell to me,<br /></span>

<p>The numbers being continued as long as the ball could be kept
rebounding against the tree.</p>

<p>The following from Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, p. 298, is
also used for ball divination. To &#8220;cook&#8221; is to toss or throw.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_360" id="GameI_360"></a>King C&aelig;sar</h3>

<p>One player is chosen to be King C&aelig;sar by lot or naming.
All the others stand in two rows, one row at each end of the
ground. A line is drawn on the ground in front of them to
mark &#8220;dens.&#8221; All the players must keep within this line.
King C&aelig;sar stands in the middle of the ground. Any number
of the players can then rush across the ground from one den
to another. King C&aelig;sar tries to catch one as they run. When
he catches a boy he must count from one to ten in succession
before he leaves hold of the boy, that boy in the meantime
trying to get away. If King C&aelig;sar succeeds in holding a boy,
this boy stays in the centre with him and assists in catching the
other players (always counting ten before a captive is secured).
The dens must always be occupied by some players. If all
the players get into one den, King C&aelig;sar can go into the empty
den and say, &#8220;Crown the base, one, two, three,&#8221; three times
before any of the other players get across to that den. If he
succeeds in doing this, he can select a boy to run across from
one den to the other, which that boy must do, King C&aelig;sar
trying to catch him. Other and bigger boys can help this one
to get across, to save him from being captured, either by carrying
him or running across with him. The game ends when
all have been captured and are in the centre. King C&aelig;sar
and the other captured boys can leave the centre if they each
successively catch three players.&mdash;Barnes (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>This game is called &#8220;King-sealing&#8221; in Dorsetshire.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_362" id="GameI_362"></a>King of Cantland</h3>

<p>A game of children, in which one of a company, being chosen
King o&#8217; Cantland, and two goals appointed at a considerable
distance from each other, all the rest endeavoured to run from
one goal to the other; and those whom the King can seize in
their course, so as to lay his hand upon their heads (which
operation is called winning them), become his subjects, and
assist him in catching the remainder.&mdash;Dumfries (Jamieson).
Jamieson adds: &#8220;This game is called &#8216;King&#8217;s Covenanter&#8217; in
Roxburgh.&#8221; He also refers to the game of &#8220;King and Queen
of Cantelon,&#8221; recorded by Mactaggart. He considers the origin
of this game to be representative of the contentions about the
&#8220;Debatable Lands&#8221; on the border. This game was played at
University Coll. School, London, under the name of &#8220;Kings&#8221;
(A. Nutt).</p>

<p>The players make a rush at the King, and try to pull him down.
A tussle goes on for a longer or a shorter time, according to
the strength of the King and his skill in driving off his assailants.

in his turn assaulted in the same way. The game may go on
for any length of time. Another form of words is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chambers (<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 114) records the tradition

the governor is said to have replied in the above quatrain of

<p>whereupon he pushes down his companions. If another boy
succeeds in getting his place he becomes King, and repeats the
doggerel (G. L. Gomme). This is a very popular boys&#8217; game.
Newell (<i>Games</i>, 164) mentions it as prevalent in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>See &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_221">Tom Tiddler&#8217;s Ground</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_364" id="GameI_364"></a>King Plaster Palacey</h3>

<p>The players are a King and his three sons named White
Cap, Red Cap, Brown Cap. Red Cap says, &#8220;Plaster Palacey
had a son, whose name was old daddy White Cap.&#8221; White
Cap, in an injured voice, says, &#8220;Me, sir?&#8221; The King says,
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; White Cap answers, &#8220;You&#8217;re a liar, sir.&#8221; The
King then says, &#8220;Who then, sir?&#8221; White Cap answers,
&#8220;Old daddy Red Cap.&#8221;&mdash;Deptford, Kent (Miss Chase).</p>

<p>The game as given above is obviously incomplete, and no
description as to how the game was played was sent me.
Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 145), describes a game, &#8220;The Cardinal&#8217;s Hat,&#8221;
which is probably a variant of the original game, of which
the above is only a fragment. I remember once witnessing
a game in which a ball was passed from player to player, and
in which the dialogue was similar. When one player was told
that the ball was in his possession, the answer was, &#8220;What,
me, sir?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, you, sir.&#8221; &#8220;Not I, sir.&#8221; &#8220;Who then, sir?&#8221;
&#8220;White Cap, sir;&#8221; the questions and answers were again
repeated for Red Cap, and Blue Cap. When it was Black
Cap&#8217;s turn, I think the ball was thrown by this player to some
one else; whoever was hit by the ball had to chase and capture
one, who became questioner; but my recollection of the game
is too slight for me to be certain either of the dialogue or the
way the game terminated (A. B. Gomme). A game described
in <i>Suffolk County Folk-lore</i>, p. 62, is apparently a version of
this. It is there described as a forfeit game.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In Sheffield a ring of young men and women is formed.
A man goes inside the ring and walks round within it, whilst the
others sing the verse. The young man then chooses a sweetheart,
and the two walk round arm-in-arm within the ring,
whilst the same verses are sung. When the singing is ended,
the girl picks a young man, and so they all pair off.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Mr. Addy entitles this game &#8220;Kiss in the Ring.&#8221; It
appears, however, from this description to lack the two
principal elements of most &#8220;<a href="#GameI_368">kiss-in-the-ring</a>&#8221; games&mdash;the
chase between pursued and pursuer, and the kissing in the
ring when the capture is made. In the Hanging Heaton
version two children kneel and kiss in the middle of the ring.

<p>&#8220;He had gone to the war, and promised to marry her when
he came back. She wrapped a shawl about her head to see if
he would recognise her.&#8221; This was all the reciter could
recollect; the lines of the ballad were sung by an old woman,
the ring answering with the game-rhyme.</p>

<p>This version seems to indicate clearly that in this game we
have preserved one of the ceremonies of a now obsolete
marriage-custom&mdash;namely, the disguising of the bride and
placing her among her bridesmaids and other young girls, all
having veils or other coverings alike over their heads and
bodies. The bridegroom has to select from among these
maidens the girl whom he wished to marry, or whom he had
already married, for until this was done he was not allowed
to depart with his bride. This custom was continued in sport<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_304" id="PageI_304">[304]</a></span>
as one of the ceremonies to be gone through after the marriage
was over, long after the custom itself was discontinued. For
an instance of this see a &#8220;Rural Marriage in Lorraine,&#8221; in
<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, iii. 267-268. This ordeal occurs in more
than one folk-tale, and it usually accompanies the incident
of a youth having travelled for adventures, sometimes in quest
of a bride. He succeeds in finding the whereabouts of the
coveted girl, but before he is allowed by the father to take
his bride away he is required to perform tasks, a final one
being the choosing of the girl with whom he is in love from
among others, all dressed alike and disguised. Our bridal veil
may probably originate in this custom.</p>

<p>In the ballad from which Mr. Newell thinks the game may
have originated, a maid has been given in marriage to another
than her chosen lover. He rides to the ceremony with a troop
of followers; the bride, seeing him approach, calls on her
maidens to &#8220;take off her gold crown and coif her in linen
white,&#8221; to test her bridegroom&#8217;s affection. This incident, I
think, is not to test &#8220;affection,&#8221; but the ordeal of recognising
his bride, however disguised, and the fact that &#8220;the hero at
once recognises his love, mounts with her on horseback, and
flees to Norway,&#8221; may be considered to support my view.</p>

<span class="i0">Lend me a pin to stick i&#8217; my thumb,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_305" id="PageI_305">[305]</a></span>He says this method of carrying is often used as a substitute
for a chair in conveying adult persons from one place to another,
especially when infirm. In other counties it is called &#8220;Queen&#8217;s
Cushion&#8221; and &#8220;Queen&#8217;s Chair,&#8221; also &#8220;Cat&#8217;s Carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brockett (<i>North Country Words</i>) says, &#8220;&#8216;King&#8217;s Cushion,&#8217; a
sort of seat made by two persons crossing their hands, in which
to place a third. The thrones on the reverses of the early
Royal Seals of England and Scotland consist of swords, spears,
snakes, &amp;c., placed in the manner of a &#8216;King&#8217;s Cushion.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The method used is for both children to grasp the wrist of
his left hand with the right, while he lays hold of the right
wrist of his companion with his left hand. This way of
hoisting or carrying is still used by schoolboys when they
desire to honour a boy who has distinguished himself in the
playground or schoolroom.</p>

(Miss A. A. Keary).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In <a href="#KissRingDorsetshire1">Dorsetshire</a> a ring is formed by all the players joining
hands except one. The odd player, carrying a handkerchief,
commences to walk slowly round the outside of the ring,
repeating the words; then, touching each one with her handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_309" id="PageI_309">[309]</a></span>
as she passes, she says, &#8220;Not you,&#8221; &#8220;not you,&#8221; &#8220;not
you,&#8221; &amp;c., &amp;c., till the favoured individual is reached, when it
is changed to &#8220;But you!&#8221; and his or her shoulder lightly
touched at the same time. The first player then runs round
the ring as fast as he can, pursued by the other, who, if a
capture is effected (as is nearly always the case), is entitled
to lead the first player back into the centre of the ring and
claim a kiss. The first player then takes the other&#8217;s place in
the ring, and in turn walks round the outside repeating the
same formula.&mdash;<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 212; Penzance (Mrs.
Mabbott).</p>

<p>In <a href="#KissRingMuchWenlock">Shropshire</a>, as soon as the player going round the ring
has dropped the handkerchief on the shoulder of the girl he
chooses, both players run <i>opposite ways</i> outside the ring, each
trying to be the first to regain the starting-point. If the one
who was chosen gets there first, no kiss can be claimed. It is
often called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_198">Drop-handkerchief</a>,&#8221; from the signal for the chase.
The more general way of playing (either with or without words),
as seen by me on village greens round <a href="#KissRingLondon">London</a>, is, when the
handkerchief has been dropped, for the player to dart through
the ring and in and out again under the clasped hands; the
pursuer must follow in and out through the same places, and
must bring the one he catches into the ring before he can
legally claim the kiss.</p>

<p>Elworthy (<i>West Country Words</i>), in describing this game,
says: &#8220;The person behind whom the handkerchief is dropped
is entitled to kiss the person who dropped it, if he or she can
catch him or her, before the person can get round the ring to
the vacant place. Of course, when a girl drops it she selects a
favoured swain, and the chase is severe up to a point, but when
a girl is the pursuer there often is a kind of donkey race lest
she should have to give the kiss which the lad takes no pains
to avoid.&#8221; Mr. Elworthy does not mention any words being
used, and it is therefore probable that this is the &#8220;<a href="#GameI_198">Drop-handkerchief</a>&#8221;
game, which generally has no kissing. It also, in
the way it is played, resembles &#8220;<a href="#GameI_231">French Jackie</a>.&#8221; In the
<a href="#KissRingStaffs">Wolstanton game</a>, Miss Keary says: &#8220;If the owner of the
handkerchief overtakes the one who is bitten as they run round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_310" id="PageI_310">[310]</a></span>
they shake hands and go into the middle of the ring, while the
others sing the marriage formula.&#8221; In Berkshire (<i>Antiq.</i> xxvii.
255) the game is played without words, and apparently no
handkerchief or other sign is used. Miss Thoyts says the
young man raises his hat when he embraces the young woman
of his choice. To &#8220;throw (or fling) the handkerchief&#8221; is a
common expression for an expected proposal of marriage
which is more of a condescension than a complimentary or
flattering one to the girl. &#8220;Kiss in the Ring&#8221; is probably a
relic of the earliest form of marriage by choice or selection.
The custom of dropping or sending a glove as the signal of
a challenge may have been succeeded by the handkerchief in
this game. Halliwell, p. 227, gives the game of &#8220;Drop Glove,&#8221;
in which a glove is used. For the use of handkerchiefs as
love-tokens see Brand, ii. 92.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_369" id="GameI_369"></a>Kit-Cat</h3>

<p>A game played by boys. Three small holes are made in
the ground, triangularly about twenty feet apart, to mark the
position of as many boys, each of whom holds a small stick,
about two feet long. Three other boys of the adverse side
pitch successively a piece of stick, a little bigger than one&#8217;s
thumb, called Cat, to be struck by those holding the sticks.
On its being struck, the boys run from hole to hole, dipping
the ends of their sticks in as they pass, and counting one,
two, three, &amp;c., as they do so, up to thirty-one, which is
game. Or the greater number of holes gained in the innings
may indicate the winners, as at cricket. If the Cat be
struck and caught, the striking party is out, and another of
his sidesmen takes his place, if the set be strong enough to
admit of it. If there be only six players, it may be previously
agreed that three <i>put outs</i> shall end the innings. Another
mode of putting out is to throw the Cat home, after being
struck, and placing or pitching it into an unoccupied hole,
while the in-party are running. A certain number of misses
(not striking the Cat) may be agreed on to be equivalent to
a put out. The game may be played by two, placed as at<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_311" id="PageI_311">[311]</a></span>
cricket, or by four, or I believe more.&mdash;Moor&#8217;s <i>Suffolk Words</i>;

<h3><a name="GameI_373" id="GameI_373"></a>Knights</h3>

<p>Two big boys take two smaller ones on their shoulders. The
big boys act as horses, while the younger ones seated on their
shoulders try to pull each other over. The &#8220;horses&#8221; may
push and strike each other with their shoulders, but must not
kick or trip up with their feet, or use their hands or elbows.
The game is usually won by the Horse and Knight who
throw their opponents twice out of three times (G. L. Gomme).<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_312" id="PageI_312">[312]</a></span>
Strutt (<i>Sports</i>, p. 84) describes this, and says, &#8220;A sport of
this kind was in practice with us at the commencement of the
fourteenth century.&#8221; He considers it to bear more analogy to
wrestling than to any other sport. He gives illustrations, one
of which is <a href="#IlloKnights">here</a> reproduced from the original MS. in the
British Museum. The game is also described in the Rev. J.
G. Wood&#8217;s <i>Modern Playmate</i>, p. 12.</p>

<p>The girl who spoke of this game, says Miss Peacock, could
only remember its details imperfectly, but as far as she recollects
it is played as follows:&mdash;The players dance round a centre
child, leaving one of their number outside the circle. The
dancers sing to the one in their midst<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here comes &mdash;&mdash;,<br /></span>

<p>At &#8220;is &mdash;&mdash; within,&#8221; the child outside the circle is named.
The centre child says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="source">&mdash;Ballynascaw School, co. Down (Miss C. N. Patterson).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <a href="#LadyLandSomerset">first Dorsetshire game</a> is played as follows:&mdash;Two
girls are chosen, the one to represent a lady and the other a
mother, who is supposed to be taking her children out to service.
She has one or more of them in each hand, and leads them up
to the lady, saying or singing the first verse. The dialogue
then proceeds, and the verse is repeated until all the children
are similarly disposed of. A few days are supposed to pass,
after which the mother calls to see her children, when the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_317" id="PageI_317">[317]</a></span>
tells her she cannot see them. At last she insists upon seeing
them, and the children are all &#8220;sat down&#8221; behind the lady,
and the mother asks one child what the lady has done to her;
and she tells her &#8220;that the lady has cut off her nose, and made
a nose-pie, and never give her a bit of it.&#8221; Each one says she
has done something to her and made a pie, and when all have
told their tale &#8220;they all turn on her and put her to prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="#LadyLandDorset">second Dorsetshire game</a> somewhat differs. One child
takes seven or eight others whom she pretends are her children.
Another child, presumably a mistress in want of servants,
stands at a distance. The first child advances, holding the
hand of her children, saying the first verse. The dialogue
is concluded, and as the woman and her children are supposed
to be out of hearing, the last couplet is said or sung. This
process is gone through again until the mistress has engaged
all the children as her servants, when she is supposed to let
them all out to play with the mustard pots, which are represented
by sticks or stones, in their hands.</p>

<p>The other versions are played as follows:&mdash;The children
form a line, the one in the middle being the mother, or widow;
they advance and retire, the mother alone singing the first verse.
One child, who is standing alone on the opposite side, who
has been addressed by the widow, then asks [not sings] the
question. The mother, or widow, sings the reply, and points
to one child when singing the last line, who thereupon crosses
over to the other side, joining the one who is standing alone.
This is continued till all have been selected. The <a href="#LadyLandBallynascaw">Ballynascaw
version</a> (Miss Patterson) is played in a similar way.
One child sits on a bank, and the others come up to her in a
long line. The &#8220;old woman&#8221; says the first five lines. No
question is asked by the &#8220;lady,&#8221; she simply takes one child.
The &#8220;old woman&#8221; shakes hands with this child, and says
good-bye to her. When all the children have been &#8220;taken in&#8221;
by the one who personates the &#8220;lady,&#8221; the &#8220;old woman&#8221; says
the other three lines, and so one by one gets all the children
back again. The <a href="#LadyLandBerkshire">Berkshire version</a> (Miss Thoyts) is said, not
sung, and is played with two leaders, &#8220;old woman&#8221; and &#8220;lover.&#8221;
As the lover chooses a child, that one is sent behind him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_318" id="PageI_318">[318]</a></span>
holding round his waist. Each child as she goes says, &#8220;Good-bye,
mother, good-bye,&#8221; and pretends to cry. Finally they all
cry, and the game ends in a tug of war. This tug is clearly
out of place unless only half the children are selected by one
side. Miss Thoyts does not say how this is done.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is called &#8220;School-teacher&#8221; in Belfast. The
corruption of &#8220;Lady of the Land,&#8221; to &#8220;Babyland,&#8221; &#8220;Babylon,&#8221;
and &#8220;Sandiland,&#8221; is manifest. It appears to be only fragmentary
in its present form, but the versions undoubtedly indicate
that the origin of the game arises from the practice of hiring
servants. Mr. Halliwell has preserved another fragmentary
rhyme, which he thinks may belong to this game.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I can make diet bread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thick and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can make diet bread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fit for the king; (No. cccxliv.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which may be compared with the rhyme given by Chambers
(<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 136), and another version given by
Halliwell, p. 229.</p>

<p>If these rhymes belong to this game it would have probably
been played by each child singing a verse descriptive of
her own qualifications, and I have some recollection, although
not perfect, of having played a game like this in London,
where each child stated her ability to either brew, bake, or
churn. It is worth noting that the <a href="#LadyLandDean">Forest of Dean</a> and
<a href="#LadyLandBerkshire">Berkshire</a> versions have absorbed one of the &#8220;selection&#8221;
verses of the love-games. Mr. Halliwell, in recording the
<i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, Nos. cccxliii. and cccxliv., as quoted above,
says, &#8220;They are fragments of a game called &#8216;The Lady of
the Land,&#8217; a complete version of which has not fallen in my
way.&#8221; Mr. Udal&#8217;s versions from Dorsetshire are not only
called &#8220;The Lady of the Land,&#8221; but are fuller than all the
other versions, though probably these are not complete. Mr.
Newell (<i>Games</i>, pp. 56-58) gives some versions of this game.
He considers the original to have been a European game (he
had not found an English example) in which there were two
mothers, a rich and a poor one; one mother begging away, one
by one, all the daughters of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_319" id="PageI_319">[319]</a></span>(<i>d</i>) This game no doubt originates from the country practice
of hiring servants at fairs, or from a dramatic &#8220;Hirings&#8221; being
acted at Harvest Homes. The &#8220;Good-bye&#8221; of mother and
daughters belongs, no doubt, to the original game and early
versions, and is consistent with the departure of a servant to her
new home. The &#8220;lover&#8221; incident is an interpolation, but there
may have been a request on the part of the &#8220;mother&#8221; to the &#8220;lady&#8221;
not to allow the girl followers or sweethearts too soon. As to
the old practice of hiring servants, Miss Burne has noted how
distinctly it stamps itself upon local custom (<i>Shropshire Folklore</i>,
pp. 461, 464). That the practice forms the groundwork of
this game is well illustrated by the following descriptive passage.
&#8220;They stay usually two or three dayes with theire friends, and
then aboute the fifth or sixth day after Martynmasse will they
come to theire newe masters; they will depart from theire olde
services any day in the weeke, but theire desire (hereaboutes)
is to goe to theire newe masters eyther on a Tewsday or on

<p>In <i>Long Ago</i>, ii. 130, Mr. Scarlett Potter mentions that in
South Warwickshire it was customary at harvest-homes to
give a kind of dramatic performance. One piece, called &#8220;The
Hiring,&#8221; represents a farmer engaging a man, in which work
done by the man, the terms of service, and food to be supplied,
are stated in rhymes similar to the above. See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_381">Lammas</a>.&#8221;<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_56">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed, one child in the centre. The ring sing
the first verse, and then the centre child chooses one from
the ring. The chosen pair kiss when the ring has sung the
second. The first child then joins the ring, and the game
begins again. In the <a href="#LadyMountainBarnes">Barnes version</a> the centre child calls one
to her from the ring by singing the second verse and naming
the child she chooses.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game has probably had its origin in a ballad. Miss
Burne draws attention to its resemblance to the &#8220;Disdainful
Lady&#8221; (<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 561), and Halliwell mentions
a nursery rhyme (No. cccclxxix.) which is very similar. Mr.
Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 55) prints words and tune of a song which
is very similar to that ballad, and he mentions the fact that
he has seen it played as a round by the &#8220;Arabs of the street.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_323" id="PageI_323">[323]</a></span>
He considers it to be an old English song which has been fitted
for a ring game by the addition of a verse.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the <a href="#LadyHillSuffolk">Suffolk game</a> the children form a ring, a boy and
girl being in the centre. The boy is called a gentleman and
the girl a lady. The gentleman commences by singing the
first verse. Then they say alternately the questions and
answers. When the gentleman says the lines commencing,
&#8220;Stab me,&#8221; he pretends to stab the lady, who falls on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_324" id="PageI_324">[324]</a></span>
ground. Then he walks round the lady and sings the last
verse, &#8220;Rise up,&#8221; and lifts up the lady. In the <a href="#LadyHillDerbyshire">Derbyshire
game</a> only three children play, the lover, lady, and fairy. The
girl stands a little distance off. The lover says the first four
lines, then approaches the lady, falls on one knee, and says the
next line. The lady replies, and retires further away. The
lover then falls on the ground and says the next line. As this
is said the good fairy appears, touches the fallen lover with her
hand, and he is immediately well again.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This is a curious game, and is perhaps derived from a
ballad which had been popular from some more or less local
circumstance, or more probably it may be a portion of an old
play acted in booths at fair times by strolling players. It is
not, as far as I can find out, played in any other counties.

<p>are portions of a dialogue familiar to Mr. Emslie, and also
occur in some mumming plays. It may also be noted that the
curing of illness or death from a stab is an incident in these
plays, as is also the method of playing. The first lines are
similar to those of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_378">Lady on the Mountain</a>,&#8221; which see.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_380" id="GameI_380"></a>Lag</h3>

<p>A number of boys put marbles in a ring, and then they all
bowl at the ring. The one who gets nearest has the first
shot at the marbles. He has the option of either &#8220;knuckling
doon&#8221; and shooting at the ring from the prescribed mark, or
&#8220;ligging up&#8221; (lying up)&mdash;that is, putting his taw so near the
ring that if the others miss his taw, or miss the marbles in the
ring, he has the game all to himself next time. If, however, he
is hit by the others, he is said to be &#8220;killed.&#8221;&mdash;Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield
Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_381" id="GameI_381"></a>Lammas</h3>

<p>A party of boys take a few straws, and endeavour to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_325" id="PageI_325">[325]</a></span>
one between the chin and the turned-down under-lip, pronouncing
the following rhyme<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I bought a beard at Lammas fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It&#8217;s a&#8217; awa&#8217; but ae hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wag, beardie, wag!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He who repeats this oftenest without dropping the straw is
held to have won the game (Chambers&#8217; <i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 115).
This game-rhyme has an interesting reference to Lammas, and
it may also refer to the hiring of servants. Brockett (<i>North
Country Words</i>, p. 221) says, &#8220;At a fair or market where
country servants are hired, those who offer themselves stand
in the market-place with a piece of straw or green branch in
their mouths to distinguish them.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_382" id="GameI_382"></a>Lamploo</h3>

<p>A goal having been selected and bounds determined, the
promoters used to prepare the others by calling at the top of
their voices<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lamp! Lamp! Laa-o!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those that don&#8217;t run shan&#8217;t play-o!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then one of the &#8220;spryest&#8221; lads is elected to commence,
thus:&mdash;First touching the goal with his foot or leaning against
it, and clasping his hands so as to produce the letter W in the
dumb alphabet, he pursues the other players, who are not so
handicapped, when, if he succeeds in touching one without
unclasping his hands, they both make a rush for the goal.
Should either of the other boys succeed in overtaking one of
these before reaching that spot, he has the privilege of riding
him home pick-a-back. Then these two boys (<i>i.e.</i>, the original
pursuer and the one caught), joining hands, carry on the game
as before, incurring a similar penalty in case of being overtaken
as already described. Each successive boy, as he is touched
by the pursuers, has to make for the goal under similar risks,
afterwards clasping hands with the rest, and forming a new
recruit in the pursuing gang, in whose chain the outside players
alone have the privilege of touching and thus adding to their
numbers. Should the chain at any time be broken, or should
the original pursuer unclasp his hands, either by design or<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_326" id="PageI_326">[326]</a></span>
accident, the penalty of carrying a capturer to the goal is
incurred and always enforced. In West Somerset the pursuing
boys after starting were in the habit of crying out the word
&#8220;Brewerre&#8221; or &#8220;Brewarre;&#8221; noise appearing to be quite as
essential to the game as speed.&mdash;<i>Somerset and Dorset Notes
and Queries</i>, i. 186 (1888).</p>

<p>Another correspondent to the same periodical (i. 204) says
that an almost identical game was played at the King&#8217;s School,
Sherborne, some fifty years ago. It was called &#8220;King-sealing,&#8221;
and the pursuing boy was obliged by the rules to retain his
hold of the boy seized until he had uttered<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are one of the king-sealer&#8217;s men.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the latter succeeded in breaking away before the couplet
was finished, the capture was incomplete.</p>

<p>The second game described is almost identical with &#8220;<a href="#GameI_360">King
C&aelig;sar</a>,&#8221; played at Barnes.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago the game was common in some parts
of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, where it was sometimes
called &#8220;Chevy Chase.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 233.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_383" id="GameI_383"></a>Lang Larence</h3>

<p>That is, &#8220;Long Lawrence,&#8221; an instrument marked with signs,
a sort of teetotum. A &#8220;Long Lawrence&#8221; is about three inches
long, something like a short ruler with eight sides; occasionally
they have but four. On one side are ten x&#8217;s, or crosses,
forming a kind of lattice-work; on the next, to the left, three
double cuts, or strokes, passing straight across in the direction
of the breadth; on the third, a zig-zag of three strokes one way,
and two or three the other, forming a W, with an additional
stroke or a triple V; on the fourth, three single bars, one at
each end and one in the middle, as in No. 2, where they are
doubled; then the four devices are repeated in the same order.
The game, formerly popular at Christmas, can be played by
any number of persons. Each has a bank of pins or other
small matters. A pool is formed; then in turn each rolls the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_327" id="PageI_327">[327]</a></span>
&#8220;Long Lawrence.&#8221; If No. 1 comes up the player cries &#8220;Flush,&#8221;
and takes the pool; if No. 2, he puts down two pins; if No. 3,
he says &#8220;Lave all,&#8221; and neither takes nor gives; if No. 4, he
picks up one. The sides are considered to bear the names,
&#8220;Flush,&#8221; &#8220;Put doan two,&#8221; &#8220;Lave all,&#8221; &#8220;Sam up one.&#8221; It has
been suggested that the name &#8220;Lawrence&#8221; may have arisen
from the marks scored on the instrument, not unlike the bars
of a gridiron, on which the saint perished.&mdash;<i>Easthers&#8217;s Almondbury

<h3><a name="GameI_384" id="GameI_384"></a>Leap Candle</h3>

<p>The young girls in and about Oxford have a sport called
&#8220;Leap Candle,&#8221; for which they set a candle in the middle of a
room in a candlestick, and then draw up their coats into the

<h3><a name="GameI_385" id="GameI_385"></a>Leap-frog</h3>

<p>One boy stoops down sideways, with his head bent towards
his body, as low as possible. This is called &#8220;Tucking in your
Tuppeny.&#8221; Another boy takes a flying leap over the &#8220;frog,&#8221;
placing his hands on his back to help himself over. He then
proceeds to a distance of some four or five yards, and, in his
turn, stoops in the same manner as the first boy, as another<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_328" id="PageI_328">[328]</a></span>
frog. A third boy then leaps first over frog No. 1, and then
over frog No. 2, taking his place as frog No. 3, at about the
same distance onwards. Any number of boys may play in the
game. After the last player has taken his leap over all the frogs
successively, frog No. 1 has his turn and leaps over his companions,
taking his place as the last in the line of frogs. Then
No. 2 follows suit, and so on, the whole line of players in course
of time covering a good distance.&mdash;London (G. L. Gomme).</p>

<p>Leap-frog is known in Cornwall as &#8220;Leap the Long-mare&#8221;

&#8220;To play at <i>levell coil</i>, G. jouer &agrave; cul lev&eacute;: <i>i.e.</i>, to play and lift
up your taile when you have lost the game, and let another sit
down in your place.&#8221; Coles, in his <i>English Dictionary</i>, seems
to derive it from the Italian <i>leva il culo</i>, and calls it also &#8220;Pitch-buttock.&#8221;
In his <i>Latin Dictionary</i> he has &#8220;<i>level-coil</i>, alternation,
cession;&#8221; and &#8220;to play at <i>level coil</i>, vices ludendi pr&aelig;bere.&#8221;
Skinner is a little more particular and says, &#8220;Vox tesseris globulosis
ludentium propria:&#8221; an expression belonging to a game
played with little round tesser&aelig;. He also derives it from French
and Italian. It is mentioned by Jonson, <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, iii. 2:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_392" id="GameI_392"></a>Little Dog I call you</h3>

<p>A number of girls stand in a line with their backs to a wall.
One of their number is sent away to a distance, but remains
within call. Another girl, who stands in front of the line, asks
the girls one by one what they would like if they could obtain
their desires. After she has asked every one, she tells them
to turn their faces to the wall, and calls after the girl who was
sent away, saying, &#8220;Little Dog, I call you.&#8221; The girl replies,
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t come to please you.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a stick and make
you,&#8221; is the rejoinder. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care for that.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a
rice pudding for you.&#8221; &#8220;I shan&#8217;t come for that.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
a dish of bones.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll come for that.&#8221; The Dog then comes.
The girls have been previously told not to laugh whilst the
one who stands out is talking to the Dog. Then the girl says
to the Dog<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If the girl who desired the golden ball laughs, the Dog picks
her out. If nobody laughs, he guesses who the girl is that has
wished for the golden ball. If the Dog guesses correctly, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_331" id="PageI_331">[331]</a></span>
goes and stands behind him, and if he guesses incorrectly she
goes and stands behind the one who has been asking the

girl at the end of the row, who <i>must</i> have desired to be<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If the Dog guesses the right one, he takes that girl on his
side, she standing behind him. Then they draw a line and
each side tries to pull the other over it.&mdash;Sheffield (S. O. Addy).
The game, it will be seen, differs in several ways from the
other games of &#8220;Fool, Fool, come to School&#8221; type. The &#8220;fool&#8221;
becomes a definite Dog, and the players <i>wish</i> for any thing
they choose; the Dog has apparently to find out their wishes.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_393" id="GameI_393"></a>Lobber</h3>

<p>There are three or more players on each side, two stones or
holes as stations, and one Lobber. The Lobber lobs either a
stick about three inches long or a ball&mdash;(the ball seems to be a
new institution, as a stick was always formerly used)&mdash;while
the batsman defends the stone or hole with either a short stick
or his hand. Every time the stick or ball is hit, the boys
defending the stones or holes must change places. Each one
is out if the stick or ball lodges in the hole or hits the
stone; or if the ball or stone is caught; or if it can be put in
the hole or hits the stone while the boys are changing places.
This game is also played with two Lobbers, that lob alternately
from each end. The game is won by a certain number of runs.&mdash;Ireland (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, ii. 264).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_394" id="GameI_394"></a>Loggats</h3>

<p>An old game, forbidden by statute in Henry VIII.&#8217;s time.
It is thus played, according to Stevens. A stake is fixed in the
ground; those who play throw Loggats at it, and he that is
nearest the stake wins. Loggats, or loggets, are also small
pieces or logs of wood, such as the country people throw at
fruit that cannot otherwise be reached. &#8220;Loggats, little logs
or wooden pins, a play the same with ninepins, in which the
boys, however, often made use of bones instead of wooden
pins&#8221; (Dean Miles&#8217; MS.; Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>). Strutt refers
to this game (<i>Sports</i>, p. 272).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_395" id="GameI_395"></a>London</h3>

<p>A <a href="#FigLondon">diagram</a> (similar to <a href="#Fig224">Fig. 9</a> in &#8220;<a href="#GameI_311">Hopscotch</a>&#8221;) is drawn on a
slate, and two children play. A piece of paper or small piece of
glass or china, called a &#8220;chipper,&#8221; is used to play with. This
is placed at the bottom of the plan, and if of <i>paper</i>, is <i>blown</i>
gently towards the top; if of glass or china, it is <i>nicked</i> with
the <i>fingers</i>. The first player blows the paper, and in whichever
space the paper stops makes a small round <span class="lettsymb">o</span> with a slate pencil,
to represent a man&#8217;s head. The paper or chipper is then put
into the starting-place again, and the same player blows, and
makes another &#8220;man&#8217;s head&#8221; in the space where the paper
stops. This is continued until all the spaces are occupied. If
the paper goes a second time into a space already occupied by
a &#8220;head,&#8221; the player adds a larger round to the &#8220;head,&#8221; to
represent a &#8220;body;&#8221; if a third time, a stroke is drawn for a
leg, and if a fourth time, another is added for the second leg;
this completes a &#8220;man.&#8221; If three complete men in one space can
be gained, the player makes &#8220;arms;&#8221; that is, two lines are
drawn from the figures across the space to the opposite side of
the plan. This occupies that space, and prevents the other player
from putting any &#8220;men&#8221; in it, or adding to any already there.
When all the spaces are thus occupied by one player, the game
is won. Should the paper be blown on to a line or <i>outside</i> the
plan, the player is out; the other player then begins, and makes
as many &#8220;men&#8221; in her turn, until she goes on a line or outside.
Should the paper go into &#8220;London,&#8221; the player is entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_333" id="PageI_333">[333]</a></span>
to make a &#8220;head&#8221; in every space, or to add another mark to
those already there.&mdash;Westminster (A. B. Gomme). This game
resembles one described by F. H. Low in <i>Strand Mag.</i>, ii. 516.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This game is now generally played like &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_10">Oranges and
Lemons</a>,&#8221; only there is no &#8220;tug-of-war&#8221; at the end. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_341" id="PageI_341">[341]</a></span>
children hold up their clasped hands to form an arch. The
other children form a long line by holding to each other&#8217;s
dresses or waists, and run under. Those who are running
under sing the first verse; the two who form the arch sing
the second and alternate verses. At the words, &#8220;What has
this poor prisoner done?&#8221; the girls who form the arch catch
one of the line (generally the last one). When the last verse
is sung the prisoner is taken a little distance away, and the
game begins again. At <a href="#LBridgeClun">Clun</a> the players form a ring, moving
round. They sing the first and alternate verses, and chorus,
&#8220;London Bridge is broken down.&#8221; Two players outside the
ring run round it, singing the second and alternate verses.
When singing &#8220;Penny loaves&#8217;ll get stole away,&#8221; one of the
two outside children goes into the ring, the other remains and
continues her part, singing the next verse. When the last
verse is sung the prisoner is released. The <a href="#LBridgeEnborne">Berkshire game</a>
(Miss Kimber) is played by the children forming two long
lines, each line advancing and retiring alternately while singing
their parts. When the last verse is begun the children form
a ring and gallop around, all singing this last verse together.
In the <a href="#LBridgeCork">Cork version</a> (Mrs. Green) the children form a circle by
joining hands. They march round and round, singing the
verses to a sing-song tune. When singing, &#8220;If the cock should
meet a hen,&#8221; they all unclasp hands; two hold each other&#8217;s
hands and form an arch. The rest run under, saying the last
verse. The &#8220;arch&#8221; lower their hands and try to catch the
last child.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on <a href="#PageI_342">pp. 342-45</a>.
It appears from this analysis that the <a href="#LBridgeLondon">London version</a> is
alone in its faithful reflection of an actual building episode.
Three other versions introduce the incident of watching by
a man, and failing him, a dog or cock; while five versions introduce
a prisoner. This incident occurs the greatest number
of times. It is not surprising that the <a href="#LBridgeLondon">London</a> version seems to
be the most akin to modern facts, being told so near the spot
indicated by the verses, and on this account it cannot be considered
as the oldest of the variants. There remain the other
two groups. Both are distinguished by the introduction of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_346" id="PageI_346"></a></span>
human element, one as watchman, the other as prisoner. The
watchman incident approaches nearer to modern facts; the
prisoner incident remains unexplained by any appeal to modern
life, and it occurs more frequently than the others. In only
one case, the <a href="#LBridgeClun">Shropshire</a>, is the prisoner ransomed; in the
others he is sent to prison. Besides this main line of criticism
brought out by the analysis there is little to note. The
<a href="#LBridgeHurst">Hurstmonceux version</a> begins with taking lambs over London
Bridge, and the <a href="#LBridgeClun">Shropshire version</a> with the players themselves
going over; but these are doubtless foreign adjuncts, because
they do not properly prefix the main incident of the bridge
being broken. The <a href="#LBridgeBelfast">Belfast version</a> has a curious line, &#8220;Grant
said the little bee or dee,&#8221; which the <a href="#LBridgeCork">Cork version</a> renders, &#8220;Gran
says the little D.&#8221; To these there is now no meaning that
can be traced, but they help to prove that the rhyme originated
from a state of things not understood by modern players. In
all the versions with the prisoner incident it comes quite suddenly,
without any previous indication, except in the <a href="#LBridgeKent">Kent
version</a>, which introduces the exclamation, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a prisoner
I have got!&#8221; As the analysis shows the prisoner incident to be
a real and not accidental part of the game, and the unmeaning
expressions to indicate an origin earlier than modern players
can understand, we can turn to other facts to see if the origin
can be in any way traced.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game is universally acknowledged to be a very
ancient one, but its origin is a subject of some diversity of
opinion. The special feature of the rhymes is that considerable
difficulty occurs in the building of the bridge by <i>ordinary</i>
means, but without exactly suggesting that extraordinary means
are to be adopted, a prisoner is suddenly taken. The question
is, What does this indicate?</p>

<p>Looking to the fact of the widespread superstition of the
foundation sacrifice, it would seem that we may have here a
tradition of this rite. So recently as 1872, there was a scare
in Calcutta when the Hooghly Bridge was being constructed.
The natives then got hold of the idea that Mother Ganges,
indignant at being bridged, had at last consented to submit to
the insult on condition that each pier of the structure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_347" id="PageI_347">[347]</a></span>
founded on a layer of children&#8217;s heads (Gomme&#8217;s <i>Early Village
Life</i>, p. 29). Formerly, in Siam, when a new city gate
was being erected, it was customary for a number of officers to
lie in wait and seize the first four or eight persons who happened
to pass by, and who were then buried alive under the
gate-posts to serve as guardian angels (Tylor&#8217;s <i>Primitive Culture</i>,
i. 97). Other instances of the same custom and belief
are given in the two works from which these examples are
taken; and there is a tradition about London Bridge itself,
that the stones were bespattered with the blood of little children.
Fitzstephen, in his well-known account of London of
the twelfth century, mentions that when the Tower was built
the mortar was tempered with the blood of beasts. Prisoners&#8217;
heads were put on the bridge after execution down to modern
times, and also on city gates.</p>

<p>These traditions about London, when compared with the
actual facts of contemporary savagery, seem to be sufficient to
account for such a game as that we are now examining having
originated in the foundation sacrifice. Mr. Newell, in his
examination of the game, gives countenance to this theory, but
he strangely connects it with other games which have a tug-of-war
as the finish. Now in all the English examples it is
remarkable that the tug-of-war does not appear to be a part of
the game; and if this evidence be conclusive, it would appear
that this incident got incorporated in America. It is this incident
which Mr. Newell dwells upon in his ingenious explanation
of the mythological interpretation of the game. But apart
from this, the fact that the building of bridges was accompanied
by the foundation sacrifice is a more likely origin for such a
widespread game which is so intimately connected with a
bridge.</p>

<p>This view is confirmed by what may be called the literary
history of the game. The verses, as belonging to a game, have
only recently been recorded, and how far they go back into
tradition it is impossible to say. Dr. Rimbault is probably
right when he states &#8220;that they have been formed by many
fresh additions in a long series of years, and [the game] is
perhaps almost interminable when received in all its different<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_348" id="PageI_348">[348]</a></span>
versions&#8221; (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, ii. 338). In <i>Chronicles of
London Bridge</i>, pp. 152, 153, the author says he obtained the
following note from a Bristol correspondent:&mdash;&#8220;About forty
years ago, one moonlight night in the streets of Bristol, my
attention was attracted by a dance and chorus of boys and
girls, to which the words of this ballad gave measure. The
breaking down of the Bridge was announced as the dancers
moved round in a circle hand in hand, and the question,
&#8216;How shall we build it up again?&#8217; was chanted by the
leader while the rest stood still.&#8221; This correspondent also
sent the tune the children sang, which is printed in the
<i>Chronicles of London Bridge</i>. This was evidently the same
game, but it would appear that the verses have also been
used as a song, and it would be interesting to find out which
is the more ancient of the two&mdash;the song or the game; and to
do this it is necessary that we should know something of the
history of the song. A correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>
(ii. 338) speaks of it as a &#8220;lullaby song&#8221; well known in the
southern part of Kent and in Lincolnshire. In the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s
Magazine</i> (1823, Part II. p. 232) appeared the following
interesting note:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The projected demolition of London Bridge recalls to my
mind the introductory lines of an old ballad which more than
seventy years ago I heard plaintively warbled by a lady who
was born in the reign of Charles II., and who lived till nearly
the end of that of George II. I now transcribe the lines, not
as possessing any great intrinsic merit, but in the hope of
learning from some intelligent correspondent the name of the
author and the story which gave rise to the ballad, for it probably
originated in some accident that happened to the old
bridge. The &#8220;Lady Lea&#8221; evidently refers to the river of that
name, the favourite haunt of Isaac Walton, which, after fertilising
the counties of Hertford, Essex, and Middlesex, glides
into the Thames.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The two lines in <i>italic</i> are all regularly repeated after each
line.&mdash;M. Green.</p>

<p>Another correspondent to this magazine, in the same volume,
p. 507, observes that the ballad concerning London Bridge
&#8220;formed, in my remembrance, part of a Christmas Carol, and
commenced thus<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dame, get up and bake your pies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Christmas-day in the morning.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The requisition goes on to the dame to prepare for the feast,
and her answer is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">London Bridge is fallen down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Christ-mas day in the morning, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The inference always was, that until the bridge was rebuilt
some stop would be put to the Dame&#8217;s Christmas operations;
but why the falling of London Bridge should form part of a
Christmas Carol at Newcastle-upon-Tyne I am at a loss to
know.&#8221; Some fragments were also printed in the <i>Mirror</i> for
November 1823; and a version is also given by Ritson,
<i>Gammer Gurton&#8217;s Garland</i>. The <i>Heimskringla</i> (Laing, ii. 260,
261) gives an animated description of the Battle of London
Bridge, when Ethelred, after the death of Sweyn, was assisted
by Olaf in retaking and entering London, and it is curious,
that the first line of the game-rhyme appears<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If this is anything more than an accidental parallel, we come
back to an historical episode wherein the breaking down and
rebuilding of London Bridge occur, and it looks as if the two
streams down which this tradition has travelled, namely, first,
through the game, and second, through the song, both refer to
the same event.</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault has, in his <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>, p. 34, reconstructed
a copy of the original rhyme from the versions given
by Halliwell and the <i>Mirror</i>, and gives the tune to which it
was sung, which is reprinted <a href="#SongLBridgeRimbault">here</a>. The <a href="#SongLBridgeWrotham">tune from Kent</a> is
the one generally used in London versions. The tune of a
country dance called &#8220;London Bridge&#8221; is given in Playford&#8217;s
<i>Dancing Master</i>, 1728 edition.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_58">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_397" id="GameI_397"></a>Long-duck</h3>

<p>A number of children take hold of each other&#8217;s hands and
form a half-circle. The two children at one end of the line lift
up their arms, so as to form an arch, and call &#8220;Bid, bid, bid,&#8221;
the usual cry for calling ducks. Then the children at the other
end pass in order through the arch. This process is repeated,
and they go circling round the field.&mdash;Addy&#8217;s <i>Sheffield Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_399" id="GameI_399"></a>Long-Tawl</h3>

<p>A game at marbles where each takes aim at the other in
turn, a marble being paid in forfeit to whichever of the players
may make a hit.&mdash;Lowsley&#8217;s <i>Berkshire Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_400" id="GameI_400"></a>Long Terrace</h3>

<p>Every player chooses a partner. The couples stand immediately
in front of each other, forming a long line, one
remaining outside of the line on the right-hand side, who is
called the &#8220;Clapper.&#8221; The object of the game is for the last
couple to reach the top of the line, each running on different
sides, and keeping to the side on which they are standing.
The object of the Clapper is to hit the one running on the
right side of the line, which, if he succeeds in doing, makes
him the Clapper, and the Clapper takes his place. [The next
<i>last</i> couple would then presumably try and reach the top.]&mdash;East
Kirkby, Lincs. (Miss K. Maughan).</p>

<p>A similar game to this is played at Sporle, Norfolk (Miss
Matthews). It is there called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_398">Long Tag</a>.&#8221; The players
stand in line behind one another, and an odd one takes her
place somewhere near the front; at a given signal, such as
clapping of hands, the two at the back separate and try to
meet again in front before the one on the watch can catch
them; they may run where they please, and when one is caught
that one becomes the one &#8220;out.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_401" id="GameI_401"></a>Loup the Bullocks</h3>

<p>Young men go out to a green meadow, and there on all-fours
plant themselves in a row about two yards distant from
each other. Then he who is stationed farthest back in the
&#8220;bullock rank&#8221; starts up and leaps over the other bullocks
before him, by laying his hands on each of their backs; and
when he gets over the last one leans down himself as before,
whilst all the others, in rotation, follow his example; then he
starts and leaps again.</p>

<p>I have sometimes thought that we (the Scotch) have borrowed
this recreation from our neighbours of the &#8220;Green Isle,&#8221; as at
their wakes they have a play much of the same kind, which
they call &#8220;Riding Father Doud.&#8221; One of the wakers takes a
stool in his hand, another mounts that one&#8217;s back, then Father
Doud begins rearing and plunging, and if he unhorses his
rider with a dash he does well. There is another play (at<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_352" id="PageI_352">[352]</a></span>
these wakes) called &#8220;Kicking the Brogue,&#8221; which is even
ruder than &#8220;Riding Father Doud,&#8221; and a third one called
&#8220;Scuddieloof.&#8221;&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>.</p>

<p>Patterson (<i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>) mentions a game called
&#8220;<a href="#GameI_386">Leap the Bullock</a>,&#8221; which he says is the same as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_385">Leap-frog</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dickinson&#8217;s <i>Cumberland Glossary Supplement</i>, under &#8220;Lowp,&#8221;
says it means a leap or jump either running or standing. The
various kinds include &#8220;Catskip&#8221;&mdash;one hitch, or hop, and one
jump; &#8220;Hitch steppin&#8221;&mdash;hop, step, and lowp; a hitch, a step,
and a leap; &#8220;Otho&#8221;&mdash;two hitches, two steps, and a leap; &#8220;Lang
spang&#8221;&mdash;two hitches, two steps, a hitch, a step, and a leap.</p>

<p class="source">&mdash;Dorsetshire (Miss M. Kimber).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed and the children dance round, singing
the first verse. They then stand till, sing the next verse, and,
while singing, suit the action to the word, each child turning
herself rapidly round when singing the last line. The first
verse is then repeated, and the fourth sung in the same way
as the second, and so on.</p>

<p>Another way of playing is that the children do not dance
round and round. They form a ring by joining hands, and
they then all move in one direction, about half way round,
while singing the first line, &#8220;lubin;&#8221; then back again in the
opposite direction, while singing the second line, &#8220;light,&#8221; still
keeping the ring form, and so on for the third and fourth lines.
In each case the emphasis is laid upon the &#8220;Here&#8221; of each
line, the movement being supposed to answer to the &#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="#LubinDorsetshire">Dorsetshire version</a> (Miss M. Kimber) is played by the
children taking hands in pairs, forming a ring, and dancing
round. At <a href="#LubinEckington">Eckington</a> (S. O. Addy) the children first pretend
to wash their hands, then their face, while singing the words;
then comb their hair and brush their clothes; then they join
hands and dance round in a ring singing the words which
follow, again suiting their actions to the words sung.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#LubinChambers">Scottish version</a> a ring is formed as above. One
sings, and the rest join, to the tune of &#8220;Lillibullero,&#8221; the first
line. As soon as this is concluded each claps his hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_360" id="PageI_360">[360]</a></span>
wheels grotesquely, singing the second line. They then sing
the third line, suiting the action to the word, still beating the
time; then the second again, wheeling round and clapping
hands. When they say &#8220;A&#8217; feet in, and nae feet out,&#8221; they
all sit down with their feet stretched into the centre of the
ring.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The other variants which follow the <a href="#LubinHalliwell">Halliwell version</a> are
limited to the first verse only, as the remainder of the lines are
practically the same as those given in <a href="#LubinOxford">Miss Fowler&#8217;s version</a>
which is written at length, and three or four of these apparently
retain only the verse given. A London version, collected
by myself, is nearly identical with that of Miss Fowler, except
that the third line is &#8220;Shake your &mdash;&mdash; a little, a little,&#8221; instead
of as printed. This is sung to the <a href="#SongLubinLondon">tune</a> given.</p>

<p>The incidents in this game are the same throughout. The
only difference in all the versions I have collected being in the
number of the different positions to be performed, most of them
being for right hands, left hands, right feet, left feet, and heads;
others, probably older forms, having &#8220;ears,&#8221; &#8220;yourselves,&#8221; &amp;c.
One version, from <a href="#LubinEckington">Eckington</a>, Derbyshire, curiously begins with
&#8220;washing hands and face,&#8221; &#8220;combing hair,&#8221; &amp;c., and then
continuing with the &#8220;Looby&#8221; game, an apparent &#8220;mix-up&#8221;
of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_429">Mulberry Bush</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Looby.&#8221; Three more versions,
<a href="#LubinSporle">Sporle</a>, <a href="#LubinCornwall">Cornwall</a>, and <a href="#LubinDorsetshire">Dorsetshire</a>, also have different beginnings,
one (<a href="#LubinDorsetshire">Dorsetshire</a>) having the apparently unmeaning &#8220;I
love Antimacassar.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The origin and meaning of this game appears somewhat
doubtful. It is a choral dance, and it may owe its origin to a
custom of wild antic dancing in celebration of the rites of some
deity in which animal postures were assumed. The <a href="#LubinHexham">Hexham
version</a>, &#8220;Here we come louping [leaping]&#8221; may probably be
the oldest and original form, especially if the conjecture that
this game is derived from animal rites is accepted. The term
&#8220;looby,&#8221; &#8220;lubin,&#8221; or &#8220;luby&#8221; does not throw much light on the
game. Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) says, &#8220;Looby is an old form
of the modern &#8216;lubber,&#8217; a &#8216;clumsy fellow,&#8217; &#8216;a dolt.&#8217;&#8221; That a
stupid or ridiculous meaning is attached to the word &#8220;looby&#8221; is
also shown by one of the old penances for redeeming a forfeit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_361" id="PageI_361">[361]</a></span>
where a player has to lie stretched out on his back and
declare,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here I lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The length of a looby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breadth of a booby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three parts of a jackass.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <a href="#LubinChambers">Scottish forms</a> of the game bear on the theory of the
game being grotesque. The fact of the players having both
their arms extended at once, one behind and one in front of
them, and the more frequent spinning round, suggest this.
Then, too, there is the sudden &#8220;sit down&#8221; posture, when &#8220;all
feet in&#8221; is required.</p>

<p>In the version given by <a href="#LubinHalliwell">Halliwell</a> there is more difficulty in
the game, and possibly more fun. This version shows the
game to be cumulative, each player having to go through an
additional antic for each verse sung. This idea only needs to
be carried a little further to cause the players to be ridiculous
in their appearance. This version would be more difficult to
perform, and they would be exhausted by the process, and the
constant motion of every member of the body. Attention, too,
might be drawn to the word &#8220;Hinkumbooby&#8221; occurring in
Chambers&#8217;s version. Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 131) mentions that
some sixty years ago the game was danced deliberately and
decorously, as old fashion was, with slow rhythmical movement.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_48a">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="GameI_403" id="GameI_403"></a>Lug and a Bite</h3>

<p>A boy flings an apple to some distance. All present race
for it. The winner bites as fast as he can, his compeers
<i>lugging</i> at his ears in the meantime, who bears it as well as
he can, and then he throws down the apple, when the sport is
resumed (Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>). Brogden&#8217;s <i>Lincolnshire Provincial
Words</i> says &#8220;Luggery-bite&#8221; is a game boys play with
fruit. One bites the fruit, and another pulls his hair until he
throws the fruit away. The game is also played in Lancashire
(<i>Reliquary</i>).</p>

by the &#8220;lugs,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, ears; hence the name (Patterson&#8217;s <i>Antrim
and Down Glossary</i>). Jamieson says that the leader had to
repeat a rhyme, and if he made a mistake, he in turn became
Luggie. The rhyme is not recorded.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_407" id="GameI_407"></a>Magic Whistle</h3>

<p>All the players but three sit on chairs, or stand in two long
rows facing each other. One player sits at one end of the two
rows as president; another player is then introduced into the
room by the third player, who leads him up between the two
rows. He is then told to kneel before the one sitting at the
end of the row of players. When he kneels any ridiculous
words or formula can be said by the presiding boy, and then he
and those players who are nearest to the kneeling boy rub his
back with their hands for two or three minutes. While they
are doing this the boy who led the victim up to the president
fastens a string, to which is attached a small whistle, to the
victim&#8217;s coat or jacket. It must be fastened in such a way
that the whistle hangs loosely, and will not knock against his
back. The whistle is then blown by the player who attached
it, and the kneeling boy is told to rise and search for the
Magic Whistle. The players who are seated in the chairs
must all hold their hands in such a way that the victim suspects
it is in their possession, and proceeds to search. The
whistle must be blown as often as possible, and in all directions,
by those players only who can do so without the victim being
able to either see or feel that he is carrying the whistle with
him.&mdash;London (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>This game is also called &#8220;Knight of the Whistle.&#8221; The boy
who is to be made a Knight of the Order of the Whistle, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_363" id="PageI_363">[363]</a></span>
led up between the two rows of players, has a cloak put round
his shoulders and a cap with a feather in it on his head. The
whistle is then fastened on to the cloak. This is described
by the Rev. J. G. Wood (<i>Modern Playmate</i>, p. 189). Newell
(<i>Games</i>, p. 122) gives this with a jesting formula of initiation
into knighthood. He says it was not a game of children, but
belonged to an older age.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_409" id="GameI_409"></a>Malaga, Malaga Raisins</h3>

<p>A forfeit game. The players sat in a circle. One acquainted
with the trick took a poker in his right hand, made some
eccentric movements with it, passed it to his left, and gave it to
his next neighbour on that side, saying, &#8220;Malaga, Malaga
raisins, very good raisins I vow,&#8221; and told him to do the same.
Should he fail to pass it from right to left, when he in his
turn gave it to his neighbour, without being told where the
mistake lay, he was made to pay a forfeit.&mdash;Cornwall (<i>Folk-lore
Journal</i>, v. 50).</p>

<p>&#8220;Malaga raisins are very good raisins, but I like Valencias
better,&#8221; is the saying used in the London version of this game,
and instead of using a poker a paper-knife is used, and it is
played at the table. Other formul&aelig; for games of this kind are,
&#8220;As round as the moon, has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.&#8221;
These words are said while drawing on a table with the forefinger
of the <i>left</i> hand an imaginary face, making eyes, nose,
and mouth when saying the words. The fun is caused through
those players who are unacquainted with the game drawing
the imaginary face with the right hand instead of the left.
Another formula is to touch each finger of the right hand
with the forefinger of the left hand, saying to each finger in
succession, &#8220;Big Tom, Little Tom, Tommy, Tom, Tom.&#8221; The
secret in this case is to say, &#8220;Look here!&#8221; before commencing
the formula. It is the business of those players who know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_364" id="PageI_364">[364]</a></span>
game to say the words in such a way that the uninitiated imagine
the saying of the words correctly with particular accents on
particular words to be where the difficulty lies. If this is well
done, it diverts suspicion from the real object of these games.&mdash;A.
B. Gomme.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_410" id="GameI_410"></a>Marbles</h3>

<p>Brand considers that marbles had their origin in bowls, and
received their name from the substance of which the bowls
were formerly made. Strutt (<i>Sports</i>, p. 384) says, &#8220;Marbles
have been used as a substitute for bowls. I believe originally
nuts, round stones, or any other small things that could easily
be bowled along were used as marbles.&#8221; Rogers notices
&#8220;Marbles&#8221; in his <i>Pleasures of Memory</i>, l. 137:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Different kinds of marbles are alleys, barios, poppo, stonies.
Marrididdles are marbles made by oneself by rolling and baking
common clay. By boys these are treated as spurious and are
always rejected. In barter, a bary = four stonies; a common
white alley = three stonies. Those with pink veins being considered
best. Alleys are the most valuable and are always
reserved to be used as &#8220;taws&#8221; (the marble actually used by the
player). They are said to have been formerly made of different
coloured alabaster. See also Murray&#8217;s <i>New English Dict.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form a ring, one child laying or kneeling
down in the centre. The ring sing the first, third, fifth, and
alternate verses; the girl in the middle answers with the
second, fourth, and so on alternately. At the last verse the
girl jumps up and breaks through the ring by force; another
girl takes her place in the ring, and the game begins again.
The <a href="#BrownNinfield">Sussex version</a> of &#8220;Mary Brown&#8221; (Chas. Wise) is played
by the children standing in line and advancing and retiring
towards the lying or kneeling child. The <a href="#BrownBarnes2">Barnes version</a> of
&#8220;Rise, Daughter&#8221; is also played in this way. The &#8220;daughter&#8221;
lays down, and at the end of the game joins the line, and
another lays down. In the <a href="#BrownHurst">Hurstmonceux version</a>, when the
last verse is sung, the girl in the middle rises and picks a
boy out of the ring; he goes in the middle with her, and they
kiss. The version given by <a href="#BrownHalliwell">Halliwell</a> is played in the same

Swedish ballad or ring dance-song, entitled &#8220;Fair Gundela,&#8221;
he considers this may be a prototype of the English game, or
that they may both be indebted to a more primitive original.
The Swedish game rather gives the idea of a maiden who has
sought supernatural assistance from a wise woman, or witch, to
ask after the fate of those dear to her, and the English versions
may also be dramatic renderings of a ballad of this character.
Mr. Jacobs&#8217; <i>More English Fairy Tales</i>, p. 221, considers this
game to have originated from the Tale of the &#8220;Golden Ball.&#8221;</p>

<p class="source">&mdash;Chambers&#8217; <i>Popular Rhymes</i>, pp. 132-134.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At <a href="#MerryBiggar">Biggar</a> (Mr. Ballantyne) this game was generally
played on the green by boys and girls. A ring is formed by
all the children but one, joining hands. The one child stands
in the centre. The ring of children dance round the way of
the sun, first slowly and then more rapidly. First all the
children in the ring bow to the one in the centre, and she bows
back. Then they dance round singing the first and second
verses, the second verse being addressed to the child in the
centre. She then whispers a boy&#8217;s name to one in the ring.
This girl then sings the third verse. None in the ring are
supposed to be able to answer, and the name of the chosen
boy is then said aloud by the girl who asked the question.
If the name is satisfactory the ring sing the fourth verse, and
the two players then retire and walk round a little. If the
name given is not satisfactory the ring sing the fifth verse, and
another child must be chosen. When the two again stand in
the centre the boys sing the sixth verse. The girls answer with
the seventh. Then all the ring sing the next verses, imitating
washing clothes, wringing, ironing, baking bread, washing
hands, combing hair, &amp;c., suiting their actions to the words of the
verses sung. The boy who was chosen then presents a ring,
usually a blade of grass wrapped round her finger, to the girl.
The ring then sing the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
verses. When all have chosen, if any lad is left without a
partner, the last verse is sung.</p>

<p>The version recorded by <a href="#MerryChambers">Chambers</a> is similar in action, but
there are some important differences in detail. The centre
child acts as mistress of the ceremonies. The ring of children
dance round her, singing the verses. At the end of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_374" id="PageI_374">[374]</a></span>
line of the second verse they all courtesy to her, and she returns
the compliment. At the conclusion of this verse she selects a
girl from the ring and asks her her sweetheart&#8217;s name, which is
imparted in a whisper. Upon this the child in the centre sings
the third verse, the ring dancing round as before. If the ring
approves her choice, they sing the fourth verse as in the Biggar
version, and if they disapprove, the fifth. Chambers does not
say whether another child is selected, if this is the case; but it
is probable, as he says, the marriage is finally concluded upon
and effected by the ring singing the verses which follow.
When singing the first line of the eighth verse all the ring
unclasps hands for a moment, and each child performs a
pirouette, clapping her hands above her head.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It seems very clear from both the versions given that
this is a ceremonial dance, round or at a place sacred to such
ceremonies as betrothal and marriage. The version given by
<a href="#MerryChambers">Chambers</a> suggests this the more strongly, as the child in the
centre acts as mistress of the ceremonies, or &#8220;go-between,&#8221;
the person who was the negotiator between the parents on
either side in bringing a marriage about. The courtesying and
bowing of those in the ring to her may show respect for this
office. On the other hand, there is the more important office
of priest or priestess of &#8220;the stones&#8221; suggested by the action
of the game, and the reverence to the centre child may be a
relic of this. The fact that she asks a girl to tell her her sweetheart&#8217;s
name, and then announces the name of the girl&#8217;s choice
for approval or disapproval by the ring in both versions, points
to the time when consent by relations and friends on both
sides was necessary before the marriage could be agreed upon&mdash;the
inquiry regarding the qualifications of the proposed wife,
the recital of her housewifely abilities, and the giving of the
ring by the boy to the girl are also betrothal customs. It is
to be noted that it was a popular belief in ancient times that
to wed with a rush-ring was a legal marriage, without the
intervention of a priest or the ceremonies of marriage. Poore,
Bishop of Salisbury (circa 1217), prohibited the use of them<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="source">&mdash;Spenser&#8217;s <i>Queen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_375" id="PageI_375">[375]</a></span>And Shakespeare alludes to the custom in the lines&mdash;&#8220;As
fit as ten groats for the hand of an attorney, as Tib&#8217;s rush
for Tom&#8217;s forefinger.&#8221;&mdash;<i>All&#8217;s Well that Ends Well.</i> The rejoicing
and bestowal of the blessing by the ring of friends
give an almost complete picture of early Scotch marriage
custom. A version of this game, which appeared in the <i>Weekly
Scotsman</i> of October 16, 1893, by Edgar L. Wakeman, is
interesting, as it confirms the above idea, and adds one or two
details which may be important, <i>i.e.</i>, the &#8220;choose your maidens
one by one,&#8221; and &#8220;sweep the house till the bride comes home.&#8221;
This game is called the &#8220;Gala Ship,&#8221; and the girls, forming a
ring, march round singing<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three times round goes the gala, gala ship,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Three times round goes the gala, gala ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sinks to the bottom of the sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They repeat this thrice, courtesying low. The first to courtesy
is placed in the centre of the circle, when the others sing:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Choose your maidens one by one,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And down goes (all courtesy)<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Merrima Tansa!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She chooses her maidens. They take her to a distance,
when she is secretly told the name of her lover. The remainder
of the girls imitate sweeping, and sing several stanzas to the
effect that they will &#8220;sweep the house till the bride comes
home,&#8221; when the bride is now placed within the circle, and
from a score to a hundred stanzas, with marching and various
imitations of what the lucky bride accomplishes or undergoes,
are sung. Each one closes with &#8220;Down goes Merrima Tansa&#8221;
and the head-ducking; and this wonderful music-drama of
childhood is not concluded until the christening of the bride&#8217;s
first-born, with<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_376" id="PageI_376">[376]</a></span>Jamieson gives the game as a ring within which one goes
round with a handkerchief, with which a stroke is given in
succession to every one in the ring; the person who strikes, or
the taker, still repeating this rhyme:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here I gae round the jingie ring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here I gae round the jingie ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And through my merry-ma-tanzie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the handkerchief is thrown at one in the ring, who is
obliged to take it up and go through the same process. He
also mentions another account of the game which had been
sent him, which describes the game as played in a similar
manner to the versions given by <a href="#MerryChambers">Chambers</a>.</p>

<p>Stewart, in his <i>Ben Nevis and Glencoe</i>, p. 361, records the
following rhyme:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One child stands apart and personates the Mother. The
other children form a line, holding hands and facing the
Mother. They advance and retire singing the first, third, and
alternate verses, while the Mother, in response, sings the
second and alternate verses. While the last verse is being
sung the children all run off; the Mother runs after them,
catches them, and beats them. Either the first or last caught
becomes Mother in next game. In the <a href="#MilkingBerrington">Shropshire game</a> the
Mother should carry a stick. In the <a href="#MilkingNorfolk">Norfolk version</a> the
Mother sits on a form or bank, the other children advancing
and retiring as they sing. After the last verse is sung the
children try to seat themselves on the form or bank where the
Mother has been sitting. If they can thus get home without
the Mother catching them they are safe. The <a href="#MilkingKent">Kentish game</a> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_387" id="PageI_387">[387]</a></span>
played with two lines of children advancing and retiring. This
was also the way in which the <a href="#MilkingLondon1">London version</a> (A. B. Gomme)
was played. In the <a href="#MilkingHants">version</a> sent by Mr. H. S. May a ring is
formed by the children joining hands. One child stands in
the centre&mdash;she represents the Mother. The ring of children
say the first, third, and every alternate verse. The child in
the centre says the second, fourth, and alternate verses, and
the game is played as above, except that when the Mother has
said the last verse the children call out, &#8220;Good job, too,&#8221; and
run off, the Mother chasing them as above. The game does
not appear to be sung.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is somewhat of a cumulative story, having for
its finish the making angry and tormenting of a mother. All
the versions point to this. One interesting point, that of milk-pails,
is, it will be seen, gradually losing ground in the rhymes.
Milk-pails were pails of wood suspended from a yoke worn on
the milkmaid&#8217;s shoulders, and these have been giving place
to present-day milk-cans. Consequently we find in the
rhymes only four versions in which milk-pails are used. In
two versions even the sense of milking-can has been lost,
and the <a href="#MilkingSShields">South Shields version</a>, sent me by little Miss Blair,
has degenerated into &#8220;male-scales,&#8221; a thoroughly meaningless
phrase. The <a href="#MilkingWight">Cowes version</a> (Miss Smith) has arrived at
&#8220;wash-pan.&#8221; The &#8220;burden&#8221; of the <a href="#MilkingBerrington">Chirbury version</a> is &#8220;a
rea, a ria, a roses,&#8221; and the <a href="#MilkingSheffield1">Sheffield version</a> is also remarkable: the
&#8220;I, O, OM&#8221; refers, probably, to something now forgotten,
or it may be the &#8220;Hi, Ho, Ham!&#8221; familiar in many nursery
rhymes. The game seems to point to a period some time back,
when milking was an important phase of the daily life, or perhaps
to the time when it was customary for the maids and
women of a village to go to the hilly districts with the cows
(summer shealings) for a certain period of time. The references
to domestic life are interesting. The scarcity of beds, the best
or feather bed, and the children&#8217;s bed, seeming to be all those
available. The feather bed is still a valued piece of household
furniture, and is considered somewhat of the nature of a heirloom,
feather beds often descending from mother to daughter for
some generations. I have been told instances of this. Gregor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_388" id="PageI_388">[388]</a></span>
in <i>Folk-lore of East of Scotland</i>, p. 52, describes the Scottish
box-bed. The &#8220;truckle bed&#8221; and &#8220;footman&#8217;s bed&#8221; probably
refers to the small bed under a large one, which was only
pulled out at night for use, and pushed under during the day.
Illustrations of these beds and the children&#8217;s bed are given
in old tales. The proximity of the pig-sty to the house
is manifest. The mention of washing-tubs calls to mind the
large wooden tubs formerly always used for the family wash.
Before the era of laundresses washing-tubs must have constituted
an important part of the family plenishing. Washing
in the rivers and streams was also a thing of frequent occurrence,
hot water for the purpose of cleansing clothes not being
considered necessary, or in many cases desirable. Chambers
gives a version of the game (<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 36) and
also Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 166). Another version from Buckingham
is given by Thomas Baker in the <i>Midland Garner</i>, 1st
ser., ii. 32, in which the mother desires the daughter to &#8220;milk
in the washing-tub,&#8221; and the words also appear very curiously
tacked on to the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_198">Three Dukes a-riding</a>&#8221; game from Berkshire

<h3><a name="GameI_417" id="GameI_417"></a>Mineral, Animal, and Vegetable</h3>

<p>A ball is thrown by one player to any one of the others. The
thrower calls out at the same time either &#8220;mineral,&#8221; &#8220;animal,&#8221;
or &#8220;vegetable,&#8221; and counts from one to ten rather quickly. If
the player who is touched by the ball does not name something
belonging to that kingdom called before the number ten
is reached, a forfeit has to be paid.&mdash;London (A. B. Gomme).</p>

<p>This is more usually called &#8220;Animal, Vegetable, and
Mineral.&#8221; See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_217">Air, Fire, and Water</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_418" id="GameI_418"></a>Minister&#8217;s Cat</h3>

<p>The first player begins by saying, &#8220;The minister&#8217;s cat is
an ambitious cat,&#8221; the next player &#8220;an artful cat,&#8221; and so on,
until they have all named an adjective beginning with A. The
next time of going round the adjectives must begin with B,
the next time C, and so on, until the whole of the alphabet
has been gone through.&mdash;Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire (Miss
Matthews); Anderby, Lincolnshire (Miss Peacock).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_389" id="PageI_389">[389]</a></span>This is apparently the same game as the well-known &#8220;I
love my love with an A because she is amiable.&#8221; In this
game every player has to repeat the same sentence, but using
a different adjective, which adjective must begin with the letter
A. Various sentences follow. At the next round the adjectives
all begin with B; the next C, until a small story has been
built up. Forfeits were exacted for every failure or mistake.
The formula usually was<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I love my love with an A because she is (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). I hate her with an A
because she is (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). I took her to the sign of the (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), and

<h3><a name="GameI_420" id="GameI_420"></a>Monday, Tuesday</h3>

<p>A game played with a ball. There are seven players, who
each take a name from one of the days of the week. One
(Sunday) begins by throwing the ball against a wall, calling
out at the same time the name of one of the days, who has to
run and catch it before it falls. If this one fails to catch the
ball, the first player picks up the ball and tries to hit one of the
six with it, who all endeavour to escape being hit. If the player
succeeds, he again throws the ball against the wall, calling out
another day of the week to catch it. If a player gets hit three
times, he is out. The winner is he who has either not been
hit at all or the fewest times, or who has been able to stay in
the longest. The same game is played with twelve children,
who are named after the twelve months of the year.&mdash;London
and Barnes (A. B. Gomme); <i>Strand Magazine</i>, ii. 519 (F. H.
Low).</p>

<p>This game belongs apparently to the ball games used
for purposes of divination. Mr. Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 181)
describes a similar game to this, in which the player whose
name is called drops the ball; he must pick it up as quickly
as possible while the rest scatter. He then calls &#8220;Stand!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_390" id="PageI_390">[390]</a></span>
upon which the players halt, and he flings it at whom he
pleases. If he misses his aim, he must place himself in a bent
position with his hands against a wall until every player has
taken a shot at him. The idea of naming children after the
days of the week occurs also in the games of &#8220;<a href="#GameI_246">Gipsy</a>,&#8221;

<h3><a name="GameI_422" id="GameI_422"></a>More Sacks to the Mill</h3>

<p>A very rough game, mentioned in Dean Miles&#8217; MS., p. 180
(Halliwell&#8217;s <i>Dictionary</i>). Lowsley (<i>Berkshire Glossary</i>) says
this is &#8220;a favourite game with children at Christmas-time,
when wishing for one of a romping character,&#8221; but he does not
describe it further. Northall (<i>English Folk Rhymes</i>, p. 354)
says that in Warwickshire and Staffordshire boys torture an
unfortunate victim by throwing him on the ground and falling
atop of him, yelling out the formula, &#8220;Bags to [on] the mill.&#8221;
This summons calls up other lads, and they add their weight.<span class="addmark"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#Add_44">[Addendum]</a></span></p>

<p class="source">&mdash;Northants (Rev. W. D. Sweeting).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One girl is chosen to act as &#8220;Mother,&#8221; the rest of the
players pretend to be her children, and stand in front of her,
not in a line, but in a group. One of them, very frequently all
the children ask her the first question, and the Mother answers.
When she gives permission for the children to go out they all
curtsey three times, and run off and pretend to play. They
then return, and the rest of the dialogue is said, the Mother
asking the questions and the children replying. At the end of
the dialogue the Mother chases and catches them, one after the
other, pretending to beat and punish them. In the <a href="#MotherPlayNorthants">Northants</a>
and <a href="#MotherPlaySussex">Hurstmonceux games</a> there appears to be no chasing. In
the <a href="#MotherPlayLondon">London version</a> (Miss Dendy) only two children are mentioned
as playing. When the Mother is chasing the girl she<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_396" id="PageI_396">[396]</a></span>
keeps asking, &#8220;Where&#8217;s my share of the silver penny?&#8221; to
which the girl replies, &#8220;You may have the nut-shells.&#8221; In the
<a href="#MotherPlayCornwall">Cornish version</a>, when the Mother has caught one of the children,
she beats her and puts her hands round the child&#8217;s throat
as if she were going to hang her.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Miss Courtney, in <i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, v. 55, says: &#8220;I
thought this game was a thing of the past, but I came across
some children playing it in the streets of Penzance in 1883.&#8221; It
belongs to the cumulative group of games, and is similar in this
respect to &#8220;<a href="#GameI_416">Milking Pails</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_425">Mother, Mother, the Pot boils
over</a>,&#8221; &amp;c. There seems to be no other object in the game
as now played except the pleasures of teasing and showing
defiance to a mother&#8217;s commands, and trying to escape the consequences
of disobedience by flight, in order that the mother
may chase them. The idea may be that, if she is &#8220;out of
breath,&#8221; she cannot chastise so much. Mr. Newell (<i>Games</i>,
p. 172) gives versions of a similar game.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_424" id="GameI_424"></a>Mother Mop</h3>

<p>All the players, except one, stand two by two in front of each
other, the inner ones forming an arch with their hands united&mdash;this
is called the &#8220;oven.&#8221; The odd child is &#8220;Mother Mop.&#8221;
She busies herself with a pretended mop, peel, &amp;c., after the
manner of old-fashioned bakers, making much ado in the valley
between the rows of children. The oven soon gets demolished,
and the last child vanquished becomes &#8220;Mother Mop&#8221; the next
time.&mdash;Bitterne, Hants (Mrs. Byford).</p>

<p>It seems probable that the inner rows of children should
kneel or stoop down in order that &#8220;Mother Mop&#8221; should have
as much trouble as possible with her oven. The game may
have lost some of its details in other directions, as there is no
apparent reason why the oven is demolished or broken down.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_425" id="GameI_425"></a>Mother, Mother, the Pot Boils over</h3>

<p>A number of girls choose one of their number to represent
a witch, and another to be a mother. The Witch stands near
the corner of a wall, so that she can peep round. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_397" id="PageI_397">[397]</a></span>
Mother counts the children by the seven days of the week,
&#8220;Monday,&#8221; &#8220;Tuesday,&#8221; &amp;c., and appoints another girl to act
as guardian over them. She then pretends to go out washing,
removing to a short distance so as to be within ear-shot of the
other children. As soon as the Mother has gone, the old
Witch comes and says, &#8220;Please, can I light my pipe?&#8221; Then
the children say, &#8220;Yes, if you won&#8217;t spit on t&#8217; hearth.&#8221; She
pretends to light her pipe, but spits on the hearth, and runs
away with the girl called Sunday. Then the Guardian, among
the confusion, pretends to rush down stairs, and, failing to find
Sunday, calls out, &#8220;Mother, mother, t&#8217; pot boils over.&#8221; The
Mother replies, &#8220;Put your head in;&#8221; the Guardian says, &#8220;It&#8217;s
all over hairs;&#8221; the Mother says, &#8220;Put the dish-clout in;&#8221; the
Guardian says, &#8220;It&#8217;s greasy;&#8221; the Mother says, &#8220;Get a fork;&#8221;
the Guardian says, &#8220;It&#8217;s rusty;&#8221; the Mother says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come
mysen.&#8221; She comes, and begins to count the children, Monday,
Tuesday, up to Saturday, and missing Sunday, asks,
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Sunday?&#8221; the Guardian says, &#8220;T&#8217; old Witch has
fetched her.&#8221; The Mother answers, &#8220;Where was you?&#8221; &#8220;Up
stairs.&#8221; The Mother says, &#8220;What doing?&#8221; &#8220;Making t&#8217; beds.&#8221;
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come down?&#8221; &#8220;Because I had no shoes.&#8221;
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you borrow a pair?&#8221; &#8220;Because nobody would
lend me a pair.&#8221; &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you steal a pair?&#8221; &#8220;Do you
want me to get hung?&#8221; Then the Mother runs after her, and
if she can catch her thrashes her for letting Sunday go. Then
the Mother pretends to go out washing again, and the Witch
fetches the other days of the week one by one, when the same
dialogue is rehearsed.&mdash;Dronfield, Derbyshire (S. O. Addy).</p>

<p>This game was also played in London. The <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> were a mother, an eldest daughter, the younger
children, a witch, and a pot was represented by another child.
The Mother names the children after the days of the week.
She tells her eldest daughter that she is going to wash, and
that she expects her to take great care of her sisters, and to
be sure and not let the old witch take them. She is also to
look after the dinner, and be sure and not let the pot boil over.
The Mother then departs, and stays at a little distance from
the others. The eldest daughter pretends to be very busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_398" id="PageI_398">[398]</a></span>
putting the house to rights, sweeps the floor, and makes
everything tidy; the younger children pretend to play, and get
in the elder sister&#8217;s way. She gets angry with them, and
pretends to beat them. Now, the girl who personates the
Witch comes and raps with her knuckles on a supposed door.
The Witch stooped when walking, and had a stick to help her
along.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come in, says the eldest sister. What do you want?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me light my pipe at your fire? My fire&#8217;s out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! if you&#8217;ll not dirty the hearth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, certainly; I&#8217;ll be careful.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While the eldest sister pretends to look on the shelf for
something, the Witch &#8220;dirties&#8221; the hearth, catches hold of
Monday and runs off with her; and at this moment the pot
boils over. The child who is the pot makes a &#8220;hissing and
fizzing&#8221; noise. The daughter calls out<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mother, mother, the pot boils over.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the spoon and skim it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can&#8217;t find it.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chair&#8217;s gone to be mended.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I suppose I must come myself?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Mother here wrings her hands out of the water in the
washing-tub and comes in. She looks about and misses
Monday.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where&#8217;s Monday?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, please, Mother, please, I couldn&#8217;t help it; but some one
came to beg a light for her pipe, and when I went for
it she took Monday off.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, that&#8217;s the witch!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Mother pretends to beat the eldest daughter, tells her to
be more careful another time, and to be sure and not let the
pot boil over. The eldest daughter cries, and promises to be
more careful, and the Mother goes again to the wash-tub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_399" id="PageI_399">[399]</a></span>The same thing occurs again. The Witch comes and asks<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Please, will you lend me your tinder-box? My fire&#8217;s out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, certainly, if you&#8217;ll bring it back directly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall have it in half-an-hour.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While the tinder-box is being looked for she runs off with
Tuesday. Then the pot boils over, and the same dialogue is
repeated. The Mother comes and finds Tuesday gone. This
is repeated for all the seven children in turn, different articles,
gridiron, poker, &amp;c., being borrowed each time. Finally, the
eldest daughter is taken off too. There is no one now to watch
the pot, so it boils over, and makes so much noise that the
Mother hears it and comes to see why it is. Finding her
eldest daughter gone too, she goes after her children to the
Witch&#8217;s house. A dialogue ensues between the Witch and
the Mother. The Mother asks<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is this the way to the Witch&#8217;s house?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s a red bull that way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll go this way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s a mad cow that way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll go this way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s a mad dog that way!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She then insists on entering the house to look for her children.
The Witch will not admit her, and says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your boots are too dirty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll take my boots off.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your stockings are too dirty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll take them off.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your feet are dirty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll cut them off.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood will run over the threshold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll wrap them up in a blanket.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood will run through.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This enrages the Mother, and she pushes her way into the
supposed house, and looks about, and calls her children. She
goes to one and says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This tastes like my Monday.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Witch tells her it&#8217;s a barrel of pork.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No, no, this is my Monday; run away home.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_400" id="PageI_400">[400]</a></span>Upon this Monday jumps up from her crouching or kneeling
posture [the children were generally put by the Witch behind
some chairs all close together in one corner of the room], and
runs off, followed by all the others and their Mother. The
Witch tries to catch one, and if successful that child becomes
Witch next time.&mdash;A. B. Gomme.</p>

<p>A probable explanation of this game is that it illustrates
some of the practices and customs connected with fire-worship
and the worship of the hearth, and that the pot is a magical
one, and would only boil over when something wrong had
occurred and the Mother&#8217;s presence was necessary. The pot
boils over directly a child is taken away, and appears to cease
doing this when the Mother comes in. It is remarkable, too,
that the Witch should want to borrow a light from the fire;
the objection to the giving of fire out of the house is a well-known
and widely-diffused superstition, the possession of a
brand from the house-fire giving power to the possessor over
the inmates of a house. The mention of the spitting on the
hearth in the Sheffield version, and dirtying the hearth in the
London version, give confirmation to the theory that the desecration
of the fire or hearth is the cause of the pot boiling over,
and that the spirit of the hearth or fire is offended at the sacrilege.
The Witch, too, may be unable to get possession of a
child until she has something belonging to the house. The
journey of the Mother to the Witch&#8217;s house in search of her
children, the obstacles put in her path, and the mention of the
spilling of blood on the threshold, are incidents which have
great significance. Why the &#8220;keeling&#8221; or skimming of the
contents of the pot should be so difficult a task for the eldest
daughter that the Mother is obliged to come herself, is not so
clear; the skimming is of course to prevent the pot boiling over,
and the pot may be supposed to take the place of the Mother
or Guardian of the hearth, and tell when misfortune or trouble
is at hand. Or the &#8220;boiling over&#8221; (which, if continued, would
extinguish the fire and sully the stone) may be an offence to
the hearth spirit, who ceases then to protect the inmates of the
house. Fairies are said to have power over the inmates of a
house when the threshold and kitchen utensils are left dirty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_401" id="PageI_401">[401]</a></span>
uncared for. Thus on the theories accompanying the ancient
house ritual, this extraordinary game assumes a rational aspect,
and it is not too much to suggest that this explanation is the
correct one.</p>

<p>In the game of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_278">Witch</a>&#8221; practically the same incidents
occur, and nearly the same dialogue, but the significant elements
of pot-boiling and fire-protection do not appear in that
game. It is not certain whether we have two independent
games, or whether &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_278">The Witch</a>&#8221; is this game, the incidents of
pot-boiling and the fire-protection having been lost in its transmission
to more modern notions. Although so closely allied,
these games are not one at the present day, and are therefore
treated separately. Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 218) gives some versions
of &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_278">Witch</a>&#8221; which show a connection between that game and
this. See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_356">Keeling the Pot</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_278">Witch</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_426" id="GameI_426"></a>Mount the Tin</h3>

<p>One child throws a tin (any kind of tin will do) to some
distance, and then walks towards it without looking round.
The other children, in the meantime, hide somewhere near.
The child who threw the tin has to guard it, and at the same
time try to find those who are hiding. If he sees one he must
call the name, and run to strike the tin with his foot. He does
this until each one has been discovered. As they are seen
they must stand out. The one who was first found has to
guard the tin next time. Should one of the players be able to
strike the tin while the keeper is absent, that player calls out,
&#8220;Hide again.&#8221; They can then all hide until the same keeper
discovers them again.&mdash;Beddgelert (Mrs. Williams).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_427" id="GameI_427"></a>Mouse and the Cobbler</h3>

<p>One girl stands up and personates a mother, another pretends
to be a mouse, and crouches behind a chair in a corner. The
mother says to another player<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go and get your father&#8217;s shirt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This player goes to the chair to look for the shirt, and is
tickled or touched by the one hiding. She rushes back and
calls out<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mother, there&#8217;s a mouse.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_402" id="PageI_402">[402]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Go and get your father&#8217;s coat.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Go and get your father&#8217;s watch and chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s a mouse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Mother then goes to see herself. The second time she is
scratched and chased. When caught she takes the Mouse&#8217;s
place.&mdash;Deptford, Kent (Miss Chase).</p>

<p>This is evidently the same game as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_242">Ghost in the Garden</a>&#8221;
and &#8220;Ghost in the Copper,&#8221; in a decaying stage. There is no
<i>raison d&#8217;etre</i> for either mouse or cobbler. Probably these
words are a corruption of the older &#8220;Ghost in the Copper.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A ring is formed by the players joining hands; one child,
who is blindfolded and holds a stick, stands in the centre. The
ring dance round, singing the verse. They then stand still, and
the centre child holds out the stick and touches one of the
ring. This player must take hold of the stick. Then the
Muffin Man asks this player any questions he pleases, &#8220;Is
the morn shining?&#8221; &#8220;Is ink white?&#8221; &amp;c. The child who holds
the stick answers &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; in a disguised voice, and
the Muffin Man then guesses who it is. He is allowed three
tries. If he guesses right he joins the ring, and the child who
was touched takes his place in the centre. In the <a href="#MuffinEHeaton">Yorkshire
versions</a> no questions are asked; the blindfolded child goes to
any one he can touch, and tries to guess his or her name. The
<a href="#MuffinHolmfirth">other version</a>, sent by Mr. Hardy, is played in the same way,
and sung to the same tune. In the <a href="#MuffinCongleton">Congleton version</a> (Miss
Twemlow), the blindfolded child tries to catch one of those in
the ring, when the verse is sung. The lines, with an additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_404" id="PageI_404">[404]</a></span>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form a ring, all joining hands and dancing
round while singing the first verse. When singing the last
line they unclasp their hands, and each one turns rapidly round.
They then sing the next verse, suiting their actions to the
words they sing, again turning round singly at the last line.
This is done with every alternate verse, the first verse being
always sung as a chorus or dance in between the different
action-verses. The verses may be varied or added to at pleasure.
The actions generally consist of washing and dressing oneself,
combing hair, washing clothes, baking bread, sweeping the
floor, going to and returning from school, learning to read,
cleaning boots, and lacing stays. When &#8220;going to school,&#8221;
the children walk two by two in an orderly manner; when
&#8220;coming home from school,&#8221; jumping and running is the style
adopted; &#8220;lacing stays,&#8221; the hands are put behind and moved
first one and then the other, as if lacing; &#8220;this is the way the
ladies walk,&#8221; holding up skirts and walking primly; &#8220;gentlemen
walk,&#8221; walking with long strides and sticks. The dressing
process and cleaning boots preceded &#8220;school.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is well known, and played in almost all parts
of England. It is always played in the same way. There is
so little variety in the different versions that it appears unnecessary
to give more than one here. In the many versions sent
the only variants are: In Sporle, Norfolk, Miss Matthews says
the game is sometimes called &#8220;<i>Ivy</i> Bush,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>Ivory</i> Bush;&#8221;
and Mr. C. C. Bell, of Epworth, sends a version, &#8220;Here we go
round the Mulberry <i>Tree</i>&#8221; In Notts it is called &#8220;Holly Bush&#8221;
(Miss Winfield). A version given in the <i>Folk-lore Record</i>, iv.
174, is called the &#8220;<i>Gooseberry</i> Bush,&#8221; and Halliwell (<i>Popular
Nursery Rhymes</i>, p. 224) records a game, the &#8220;Bramble Bush.&#8221;
&#8220;The bush,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is often imaginative, but is sometimes
represented by a child in the centre.&#8221; Chambers (<i>Popular
Rhymes</i>, pp. 134, 135) gives the game as a form of the &#8220;<a href="#GameI_415">Merry-ma-tanzie</a>&#8221;&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_406" id="PageI_406">[406]</a></span>
kind of dance. They sing while moving round
to the tune of &#8220;Nancy Dawson,&#8221; and stopping short with
courtesy at the conclusion.</p>

<p>After which there is, as usual, the ring dance. They then
represent washing, ironing clothes, baking bread, washing the
house, and a number of other familiar proceedings.</p>

<p>This game originated, no doubt, as a marriage dance round
a sacred tree or bush. As it now exists it appears to have
no other character than the performance of duties such as
those enumerated in the description. In no version that I
am acquainted with do the elements of love and marriage
or kissing occur, otherwise the resemblance it bears to the
Scotch &#8220;Merry-ma-tanzie&#8221; would suggest that it is a portion
of that game. This game possesses the centre tree,
which is not preserved in &#8220;<a href="#GameI_415">Merry-ma-tansa</a>.&#8221; Trees were
formerly sacred to dancing at the marriage festival, as at
Polwarth in Berwickshire, where the custom once prevailed,
which is not unworthy of notice. &#8220;In the midst of the
village are two thorn trees near to each other; round these
every newly-married pair were expected to dance with all
their friends; from hence arose the old song, &#8216;Polwarth on
the Green&#8217;&#8221; (<i>New Statistical Account of Scotland, Polwarth,
Berwickshire</i>, ii. 234). Holland (<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>), under
&#8220;Kissing Bush,&#8221; says, &#8220;A bush of holly, ivy, or other evergreens,
which is hung up in farm kitchens at Christmas, and
serves the purpose of mistletoe. The kissing bushes are usually
prepared by the farm lads on Christmas Eve, and they are
often tastefully decorated with apples, oranges, and bits of
gay-coloured ribbon. I have occasionally seen them made
upon a framework of hoop iron something in the form of a
crown, with a socket at the bottom to hold a lighted candle.&#8221;
Brand (ii. 15) also describes how in Ireland men and women
dance round about a bush in a large ring on the Patron Day.
Newell (<i>Games</i>, p. 86), gives this game, and also mentions
one in which &#8220;barberry bush&#8221; is named. The tune in all
versions is the same. See &#8220;<a href="#GameI_415">Merry ma-tansa</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a href="#GameI_436">Nettles</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_430" id="GameI_430"></a>Munshets or Munshits</h3>

<p>Is played by two boys as follows:&mdash;One of the boys remains
&#8220;at home,&#8221; and the other goes out to a prescribed distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_408" id="PageI_408">[408]</a></span>
The boy who remains &#8220;at home&#8221; makes a small hole in the
ground, and holds in his hand a stick about three feet long to
strike with. The boy who is out at field throws a stick in the
direction of this hole, at which the other strikes. If he hits it,
he has to run to a prescribed mark and back to the hole without
being caught or touched with the smaller stick by his playfellow.
If he is caught, he is &#8220;out,&#8221; and has to go to field.
And if the boy at field can throw his stick so near to the hole
as to be within the length or measure of that stick, the boy at
home has to go out to field. A number of boys often play
together; for any even number can play. I am told that the
game was common fifty years ago. In principle it resembles
<a href="#GameI_163">cricket</a>, and looks like the rude beginning of the game.&mdash;Addy&#8217;s

<h3><a name="GameI_431" id="GameI_431"></a>Musical Chairs</h3>

<p>A line of chairs is placed in a row down a room (one chair
less than the number of children who are playing) in such a
way that every alternate chair only is available on either side
for the players to seat themselves. The children walk or
dance round the chairs, keeping quite close to them. The
piano or other musical instrument is played while they are
dancing round. The music is continued for any length of time
the player pleases, the children running round the chairs as
long as the music goes on. The player stops the music suddenly,
when all the children endeavour to take seats. One will be
unable to find a seat, and this player remains &#8220;out.&#8221; A chair
is then taken away, and the music and dancing round begins
again. There should always be one chair less than the number
of players.&mdash;A. B. Gomme.</p>

<p>In Ellesmere, Miss Burne says, &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_153">Snap-tongs</a>,&#8221; called in other
circles &#8220;<a href="#GameI_408">Magic Music</a>&#8221; or &#8220;Musical Chairs,&#8221; is thus played.
Five players take part; four chairs are set in the middle, and
one of the players, who holds a pair of tongs, desires the others
to dance round them till the clock strikes a certain hour, which
is done by snapping the tongs together so many times. While
they dance, a chair is taken away, and the player who cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_409" id="PageI_409">[409]</a></span>
find a seat has to become the &#8220;snap-tongs&#8221; next time.&mdash;<i>Shropshire
Folk-lore</i>, p. 525.</p>

<p>A game in which pegs of wood play a similar part to the

Glossary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_433" id="GameI_433"></a>Namers and Guessers</h3>

<p>Any number of players can play this game. Two are chosen,
the one to be Namer, and the other Guesser or Witch. The
rest of the players range themselves in a row. The Guesser
retires out of sight or to a distance. The Namer then gives each
player a secret name. When names have been given to all the
players, the Namer calls on the Guesser to come, by saying<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Witchie, witchie, yer bannocks are burnin&#8217;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&#8217; ready for turnin&#8217;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereupon he approaches, and the Namer says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, chois me out, come, chois me in, to &mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(naming one by the assumed name). The players all shout,
&#8220;Tack me, tack me,&#8221; repeatedly. The Witch points to one.
If the guess is correct the player goes to the Witch&#8217;s side, but
if it is incorrect he goes to the Namer&#8217;s side. This goes on
till all the players are ranged on the one side or the other. The
two parties then come to a tug, with the Namer and Guesser as
leaders. The gaining party then ranges itself in two lines with
a space between the lines, each boy holding in his hand his cap
or his handkerchief tightly plaited. The boys of the conquered
side have then to run between the two lines, and are
pelted by the victors. This is called, &#8220;Throuw the Muir o&#8217;
Hecklepin.&#8221;&mdash;Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).</p>

<p>This game is practically the same as &#8220;<a href="#GameI_222">Fool, Fool, come to

<p>A fireside game. A person puts a little trifle, such as a
button, into one hand, shuts it close, the other hand is also
shut; then they are both whirled round and round one another
as fast as they can, before the nose of the one who intends to
guess what hand the prize is in; and if the guesser be so fortunate
as to guess the hand the prize is in, it becomes his
property; the whirling of the fists is attended with the following
rhyme<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="source">&mdash;Mactaggart&#8217;s <i>Gallovidian Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>.</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Gregor says at Keith this game is played at
Christmas, and by two. The stakes are commonly pins. One
player conceals a pin, or more if agreed on, in one of his (her)
hands. He then closes both hands and twirls them over each
other, in front of the other player, and repeats the words<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nivvie, nivvie-neek-nack,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An&#8217; a&#8217;ll deceave ye gehn (if) I can.<br /></span>

<p>The other player chooses. If he chooses the hand having the
stake, he gains it. If he does not, he forfeits the stake.
Another form of words is<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_411" id="PageI_411">[411]</a></span>Dickinson&#8217;s <i>Cumberland Glossary</i> describes this as a boyish
mode of casting lots. The boy says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Patterson (<i>Antrim and Down Glossary</i>) gives the
rhyme as<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nievy, navy, nick nack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which han&#8217; will ye tak&#8217;,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll beguile ye if I can.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chambers (<i>Popular Rhymes</i>, p. 117) gives the rhyme the
same as that given by Mr. Patterson. In <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
6th Series, vii. 235, a North Yorkshire version is given as<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Jamieson (<i>Supp., sub voce</i>) adds: &#8220;The first part of the
word seems to be from neive, the fist being employed in the
game.&#8221; A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, iii. 180, says: &#8220;The
neive, though employed in the game, is not the object addressed.
It is held out to him who is to guess&mdash;the conjuror&mdash;<i>and it is
he who is addressed</i>, and under a conjuring name. In short (to
hazard a wide conjecture, it may be) he is invoked in the person
of Nic Neville (Neivi Nic), a sorcerer in the days of James VI.,
who was burnt at St. Andrews in 1569. If I am right, a
curious testimony is furnished to his quondam popularity
among the common people.&#8221; It will be remembered that this
game is mentioned by Scott in <i>St. Ronan&#8217;s Well</i>&mdash;&#8220;Na, na,
said the boy, he is a queer old cull.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He gave me half-a-crown
yince, and forbade me to play it awa&#8217; at pitch and toss.&#8221;
&#8220;And you disobeyed him, of course?&#8221; &#8220;Na, I didna disobey
him&mdash;I played it awa&#8217; at &#8216;Nievie, nievie, nick-nack.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children dance round, singing the first three lines,
turning round and clapping hands for the fourth line. They
curtsey while saying, &#8220;This is the way the lady goes,&#8221; and
again turn round and clap hands for the last line. The same
process is followed in every verse, only varying what they act&mdash;thus,
in the third verse, they bow for the gentleman&mdash;and so
the amusement is protracted <i>ad libitum</i>, with shoemaking,
washing clothes, ironing, churning, milking, making up butter,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This game is practically the same as the &#8220;<a href="#GameI_429">Mulberry

the children clap their hands at the fourth line, instead of each
turning themselves round, as in &#8220;<a href="#GameI_429">Mulberry Bush</a>.&#8221; The &#8220;High,

<p>A ring is made by marking the ground, and a tin placed in
the middle of it. One boy acts as keeper of the tin, the other
players also stand outside the ring. One of these kicks the tin
out of the ring, the others then all run to hide or squat out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_413" id="PageI_413">[413]</a></span>
sight. The keeper has to replace the tin before looking for
the boys. If, after that, he can spy a boy, that boy must come
out and stand by the ring. When another boy is spied, he
endeavours to reach the ring before the keeper does so, and kick
out the tin. If he is successful, any one of the boys who is
standing by, having been previously spied, is released from the
keeper, and again hides. The object of the keeper is to successfully
spy all the boys. When this is accomplished the last
boy becomes the keeper.&mdash;Earls Heaton, Yorks. (Herbert
Hardy).</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_438" id="GameI_438"></a>Nine Holes</h3>

<p>Nine round holes are made in the ground, and a ball aimed
at them from a certain distance; or the holes are made in a
board with a number over each, through one of which the ball
has to pass.&mdash;Forby&#8217;s <i>Vocabulary</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rural game,&#8221; says Nares, &#8220;played by making nine holes
in the ground, in the angles and sides of a square, and placing
stones and other things upon, according to certain rules.&#8221;
Moor (<i>Suffolk Words and Phrases</i>) says: &#8220;This is, I believe,
accurate as far as it goes, of our Suffolk game. A hole in the
middle is necessary.&#8221; In Norfolk, Holloway (<i>Dict. Prov.</i>) says
that nine round holes are made in the ground, and a ball
aimed at them from a certain distance. A second game is
played with a board having nine holes, through one of which
the ball must pass. Nares quotes several authors to show
the antiquity of the game. He shows that the &#8220;<a href="#GameI_439">Nine Men&#8217;s
Morris</a>&#8221; of our ancestors was but another name for &#8220;Nine
Holes.&#8221; Nine, a favourite and mysterious number everywhere,
prevails in games.</p>

<p>Strutt (<i>Sports</i>, p. 384) also describes the game as played in
two ways&mdash;a game with bowling marbles at a wooden bridge;
and another game, also with marbles, in which four, five, or six
holes, and sometimes more, are made in the ground at a distance
from each other, and the business of every one of the
players is to bowl a marble, by a regular succession, into all
the holes, and he who completes in the fewest bowls obtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_414" id="PageI_414">[414]</a></span>
the victory. In Northamptonshire a game called &#8220;Nine Holes,&#8221;
or &#8220;Trunks,&#8221; is played with a long piece of wood or bridge
with nine arches cut in it, each arch being marked with a
figure over it, from one to nine, in the following rotation&mdash;VII.,
V., III., I., IX., II., IIII., VI., VIII. Each player has
two flattened balls which he aims to bowl edgeways under the
arches; he scores the number marked over the arch he bowls
through, and he that attains to forty-five first wins the game
(Baker&#8217;s <i>Northamptonshire Glossary</i>). In <i>Arch. Journ.</i>, xlix.
320, in a paper by Mr. J. T. Micklethwaite, this game is
described, and diagrams of the game given which had been
found by him cut in a stone bench in the church of Ardeley,
Hertfordshire, and elsewhere. He has also seen the game
played in London. It is evidently the same game as described
by Nares and Moor above.</p>

<h3><a name="GameI_439" id="GameI_439"></a>Nine Men&#8217;s Morris</h3>

<p>In the East Riding this game is played thus: A flat piece of
wood about eight inches square is taken, and on it twenty-four
holes are bored by means of a hot skewer or piece of hot iron.</p>

</div>

<p>Each of the two players has nine wooden pegs, which are either
coloured or shaped differently, and the object of each player is
to get three of his own pegs in a straight line (<a href="#FigMorris1">fig. 1</a>). It is
called &#8220;<a href="#GameI_413">Merrils</a>.&#8221;&mdash;Sheffield (S. O. Addy).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_415" id="PageI_415">[415]</a></span>Cotgrave&#8217;s <i>Dictionarie</i>, 1632, says: &#8220;<i>Merelles</i>, le jeu de
merelles, the boyish game called merrils, or fiue-pennie morris.
Played here most commonly with stones, but in France with
pawns or men made of purpose, and termed merelles.&#8221; Strutt
(<i>Sports</i>, p. 317) says: &#8220;This was why the game received this
name. It was formerly called &#8216;Nine Men&#8217;s Morris&#8217; and
&#8216;Five-penny Morris,&#8217; and is a game of some antiquity. It was
certainly much used by the shepherds formerly, and continues
to be used by them and other rustics to the present hour.&#8221;
An illustration of the form of the merelle table and the lines
upon it, as it appeared in the fourteenth century, is given by
him, and he observes that the lines have not been varied.
The black spots at every angle and intersection of the lines
are the places for the men to be laid upon. The men are
different in form and colour for distinction&#8217;s sake, and from
the moving these men backwards and forwards, as though
they were dancing a morris, I suppose the pastime received
the name of &#8220;Nine Men&#8217;s Morris,&#8221; but why it should have
been called &#8220;Five-penny Morris&#8221; I do not know. The
manner of playing is briefly thus:&mdash;Two persons, having
each of them nine pieces or men, lay them down alternately,
one by one, upon the spots, and the business of either party
is to prevent his antagonist from placing three of his pieces
so as to form a row of three without the intervention of an
opponent piece. If a row be formed, he that made it is at
liberty to take up one of his competitor&#8217;s pieces from any
part he thinks most to his own advantage, excepting he has
made a row, which must not be touched, if he have another
piece upon the board that is not a component part of that
row. When all the pieces are laid down they are played
backwards and forwards in any direction that the lines run, but
can only move from one spot to another at one time. He that
takes off all his antagonist&#8217;s pieces is the conqueror. The
rustics, when they have not materials at hand to make a table,
cut the lines in the same form upon the ground and make a
small hole for every dot. They then collect stones of different
forms or colours for the pieces, and play the game by depositing
them in the holes in the same manner that they are set<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_416" id="PageI_416">[416]</a></span>
over the dots on the table. Hence Shakespeare, describing the
effects of a wet and stormy season, says<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="source">&mdash;<i>Midsummer Nights Dream</i>, act ii. sc. 2.</p>

<p>Miss Baker (<i>Northamptonshire Glossary</i>), in describing
&#8220;Merell&#8221; or &#8220;Morris,&#8221; says:&mdash;&#8220;On the inclosing of open
fields this game was transferred to a board, and continues a
fireside recreation of the agricultural labourer. It is often
called by the name of &#8216;Mill&#8217; or &#8216;Shepherd&#8217;s Mill.&#8217;&#8221; She says
the mode of playing now observed is this. Each of the players
has nine pieces, or men, differing in colour, or material, from
his adversary, for distinction&#8217;s sake; which they lay down on
the spots alternately, one by one, each endeavouring to prevent
his opponent from placing three of his pieces in a line, as
whichever does so is entitled to take off any one of his antagonist&#8217;s
men where he pleases, without breaking a row of three,
which must not be done whilst there is another man on the
board. After all the pieces are placed on the board, they are
moved alternately backwards and forwards along the lines;
and as often as either of the players succeeds in accomplishing
a row of three, he claims one of his antagonist&#8217;s men, which is
placed in the pound (the centre), and he who takes the most
pieces wins the game. It is played on a board whereon are
marked three squares, one being denominated the pound. It
is sometimes played with pegs, bits of paper, or wood, or
stone. It is called &#8220;Peg Morris&#8221; by Clare, the Northamptonshire
poet.</p>

<p>The ancient game of &#8220;Nine Men&#8217;s Morris&#8221; is yet played by
the boys of Dorset. The boys of a cottage, near Dorchester,
had a while ago carved a &#8220;Marrel&#8221; pound on a block of stone
by the house. Some years ago a clergyman of one of the
upper counties wrote that in the pulling down of a wall in his
church, built in the thirteenth century, the workmen came to a
block of stone with a &#8220;Marrel&#8217;s&#8221; pound cut on it. &#8220;Merrels&#8221;
the game was called by a mason.&mdash;Barnes&#8217; <i>Additional Glossary;
Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 233.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_417" id="PageI_417">[417]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Nine Men&#8217;s Morris,&#8217; in Gloucestershire called &#8216;Ninepenny
Morris,&#8217; was,&#8221; says a correspondent in the <i>Midland Garner</i>,
&#8220;largely practised by boys and even older people over thirty
years ago, but is now, as far as I know, entirely disused. Two
persons play. Each must have twelve pegs, or twelve pieces
of anything which can be distinguished. The Morris was
usually marked on a board or stone with chalk, and consists
of twenty-four points. The pegs are put down one at a time
alternately upon any point upon the Morris, and the first
person who makes a consecutive row of three impounds one
of his opponent&#8217;s pegs. The pegs must only be moved on the
lines. The game is continued until one or other of the players
has only two pegs left, when the game is won&#8221; (1st ser., i. 20).
Another correspondent in the same journal (ii. 2) says, &#8220;The
game was very generally played in the midland counties under
the name of &#8216;Merrilpeg&#8217; or &#8216;Merelles.&#8217; The twelve pieces I
have never seen used, though I have often played with
nine. We generally used marbles or draught pieces, and not
pegs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following are the accounts of this game given by the
commentators on Shakespeare:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In that part of Warwickshire where Shakespeare was
educated, and the neighbouring parts of Northamptonshire,
the shepherds and other boys dig up the turf with their knives
to represent a sort of imperfect chess-board. It consists of a
square, sometimes only a foot diameter, sometimes three or
four yards. Within this is another square, every side of which
is parallel to the external square; and these squares are joined
by lines drawn from each corner of both squares, and the
middle of each line. One party, or player, has wooden pegs,
the other stones, which they move in such a manner as to take
up each other&#8217;s men, as they are called, and the area of the
inner square is called the pound, in which the men taken up
are impounded. These figures are by the country people called
<i>nine men&#8217;s morris</i>, or <i>merrils</i>; and are so called because each
party has nine men. These figures are always cut upon the
green turf, or leys as they are called, or upon the grass at the
end of ploughed lands, and in rainy seasons never fail to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_418" id="PageI_418">[418]</a></span>
choked up with mud&#8221; (Farmer). &#8220;<i>Nine men&#8217;s morris</i> is a
game still played by the shepherds, cow-keepers, &amp;c., in the
midland counties, as follows:&mdash;A figure (of squares one within
another) is made on the ground by cutting out the turf; and
two persons take each nine stones, which they place by
turns in the angles, and afterwards move alternately, as at
chess or draughts. He who can play three in a straight
line may then take off any one of his adversary&#8217;s, where
he pleases, till one, having lost all his men, loses the game&#8221;
(Alchorne).</p>

<p>The following is the account of this game given by Mr.
Douce in the <i>Illustrations of Shakespeare and of Ancient
Manners</i>, 1807, i. 184:&mdash;&#8220;This game was sometimes called
the <i>nine mens merrils</i> from <i>merelles</i>, or <i>mereaux</i>, an ancient
French word for the jettons, or counters, with which it was
played. The other term, <i>morris</i>, is probably a corruption
suggested by the sort of dance which, in the progress of the
game, the counters performed. In the French <i>merelles</i> each
party had three counters only, which were to be placed in a
line in order to win the game. It appears to have been the
<i>tremerel</i> mentioned in an old fabliau. See <i>Le Grand</i>, <i>Fabliaux
et Contes</i>, ii. 208. Dr. Hyde thinks the morris, or merrils, was
known during the time that the Normans continued in possession
of England, and that the name was afterwards corrupted
into <i>three men&#8217;s morals</i>, or <i>nine men&#8217;s morals</i>. If this be true,
the conversion of <i>morrals</i> into <i>morris</i>, a
term so very familiar to the country people,
was extremely natural. The Doctor adds,
that it was likewise called <i>nine-penny</i> or
<i>nine-pin miracle</i>, <i>three-penny morris</i>, <i>five-penny
morris</i>, <i>nine-penny morris</i>, or <i>three-pin</i>,
<i>five-pin</i>, and <i>nine-pin morris</i>, all corruptions
of <i>three-pin, &amp;c., merels</i>&#8221; (Hyde&#8217;s
<i>Hist. Nederluddi</i>, p. 202). Nares says the simpler plan here
represented (<a href="#FigMorris2">fig. 2</a>), which he had also seen cut on small
boards, is more like the game than the one referred to in the
variorem notes of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Forby has, &#8220;<i>Morris</i>, an ancient game, in very common<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_419" id="PageI_419">[419]</a></span>
modern use. In Shakespeare it is called &#8216;nine men&#8217;s <i>morris</i>,&#8217;
from its being played with nine men, as they were then, and
still are called. We call it simply <i>morris</i>. Probably it took
the name from a fancied resemblance to a dance, in the motions
of the men. Dr. Johnson professes that he knew no more
of it than that it was some rustic game. Another commentator
speaks of it as common among shepherds&#8217; boys in some
parts of Warwickshire. It cannot well be more common there
than here, and it is not particularly rustic. Shepherds&#8217; boys
and other clowns play it on the green turf, or on the bare
ground; cutting or scratching the lines, on the one or the
other. In either case it is soon filled up with mud in wet
weather. In towns, porters and other labourers play it, at
their leisure hours, on the flat pavement, tracing the figure
with chalk. It is also a domestic game; and the figure is to be
found on the back of some draught-boards. But to compare
<i>morris</i> with that game, or with chess, seems absurd; as it has
a very distant resemblance, if any at all, to either, in the lines,
or in the rules of playing. On the ground, the men are
pebbles, broken tiles, shells, or potsherds; on a table, the
same as are used at draughts or backgammon. In Nares it is
said to be the same as nine-holes. With us it is certainly
different.&#8221; Cope (<i>Hampshire Glossary</i>) says that &#8220;Nine Men&#8217;s
Morrice&#8221; is a game played with counters. He does not describe
it further. Atkinson (<i>Glossary of Cleveland Dialect</i>) says
under &#8220;Merls,&#8221; the game of &#8220;Merelles,&#8221; or &#8220;Nine Men&#8217;s
Morris.&#8221; Toone (<i>Etymological Dictionary</i>) describes it as a
game played on the green sward, holes being cut thereon, into
which stones were placed by the players. Stead&#8217;s <i>Holderness
Glossary</i> calls it &#8220;Merrils,&#8221; and describes it as a game played
on a square board with eighteen pegs, nine on each side, called
in many parts &#8220;Nine Men&#8217;s Morrice.&#8221; See also <i>Sussex Arch.
Collections</i>, xxv. 234, and a paper by Mr. J. T. Micklethwaite
(<i>Arch. Journ.</i>, xlix. 322), where diagrams of this game are
given which have been found cut in several places on the
benches of the cloisters at Gloucester, Salisbury, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>This game is played on slates by school-children. The
accompanying <a href="#NoughtsCrosses">diagram</a> is drawn on the slate, and a certain
figure (generally twenty) is agreed upon as
&#8220;game.&#8221; There are two players, one takes
noughts [<span class="lettsymb">O</span>], the other crosses [<span class="lettsymb">X</span>]. The
three places drawn on the slate above the
diagram are for the players each to put down
marks or numbers for the games they win,
the centre place being for &#8220;Old Nick,&#8221; or
&#8220;Old Tom.&#8221; The object of the game is for
each player to occupy three contiguous places in a row or line
with either noughts or crosses, and to prevent his opponent<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_421" id="PageI_421">[421]</a></span>
from doing so. The diagram is of course empty when play
begins. One player commences by putting his mark into either
of the vacant places he prefers, the other player then places his
in another, wherever he thinks he has the best opportunity to
prevent his opponent getting a &#8220;three,&#8221; and at the same time
to get a three himself; then the first player plays again,
and so on alternately until all the squares are occupied, or
until one of the players has a &#8220;three&#8221; in line. If neither
player gets a &#8220;three,&#8221; the game is won by &#8220;Old Nick,&#8221; and
one is scored to his name. In the diagram the result of
the game is shown when won by &#8220;Old Nick.&#8221; Whichever
player first wins a game adds &#8220;Old Nick&#8217;s&#8221; score to his
own. In some games &#8220;Old Nick&#8221; keeps all he wins for
himself, and then most frequently wins the game.&mdash;London

<h3><a name="GameI_444" id="GameI_444"></a>Nur and Spel</h3>

<p>A boys&#8217; game in Lincolnshire, somewhat similar to &#8220;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41728/41728-h/41728-h.htm#GameII_228">Trap
Ball</a>.&#8221; It is played with a &#8220;kibble,&#8221; a &#8220;nur,&#8221; and a &#8220;spell.&#8221;
By striking the end of the spell with the kibble, the nur, of
course, rises into the air, and the art of the game is to strike
it with the kibble before it reaches the ground. He who
drives it the greatest distance wins the game.&mdash;Halliwell&#8217;s
<i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>Strutt (<i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, p. 109) describes this game as
&#8220;Northern-spell,&#8221; played with a trap, and the ball is stricken
with a bat or bludgeon. The contest between the players is
simply who shall strike the ball to the greatest distance in a
given number of strokes. The length of each stroke is measured
before the ball is returned, by means of a cord made fast
at one end near the trap, the other being stretched into the field
by a person stationed there for that purpose, who adjusts it to
the ball wherever it may lie.</p>

<p>In a work entitled the <i>Costumes of Yorkshire</i> this game is
described and represented as &#8220;Nor and Spell.&#8221; The little
wooden ball used in this game is in Yorkshire called the &#8220;Nor,&#8221;
and the receptacle in which it is placed the &#8220;Spell.&#8221; Peacock<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_422" id="PageI_422">[422]</a></span>
(<i>Manley and Corringham Glossary</i>) gives &#8220;knur,&#8221; (1) a hard
wooden ball, (2) the head. Addy (<i>Sheffield Glossary</i>) says
&#8220;knur&#8221; is a small round ball, less than a billiard ball. It is
put into a cup fixed on a spring which, being touched, causes
the ball to rise into the air, when it is struck by a trip-stick, a
slender stick made broad and flat at one end. The &#8220;knur&#8221; is
struck by the broad part. The game is played on Shrove Tuesday.
Brogden (<i>Provincial Words of Lincolnshire</i>) gives it
under &#8220;<a href="#GameI_24">Bandy</a>.&#8221; It is called &#8220;Knur, Spell, and Kibble&#8221; in
S.-W. Lincolnshire.&mdash;Cole&#8217;s <i>Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>The following letter relating to this game is extracted from
the <i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>, September 1847, in Ellis&#8217;s edition
of Brand:&mdash;&#8220;Before the commons were taken in, the children

boys, from the force of circumstances, have taken possession of
the turnpike road to play the before-mentioned games, to the
serious inconvenience of the passengers, one of whom, a
woman, was yesterday knocked down by a <i>nurr</i> which struck
her in the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brockett says of this game, as played in Durham: It is
called &#8220;Spell and Ore,&#8221; Teut. &#8220;spel,&#8221; a play or sport; and
Germ. &#8220;knorr,&#8221; a knot of wood or ore. The recreation is also
called &#8220;Buckstick, Spell, and Ore,&#8221; the buckstick with which the
ore is struck being broad at one end like the butt of a gun
(<i>North Country Words</i>). In Yorkshire it is &#8220;Spell and Nurr,&#8221;
or &#8220;Knur,&#8221; the ore or wooden ball having been, perhaps, originally
the knurl or knot of a tree. The <i>Whitby Glossary</i> also
gives this as &#8220;Spell and Knor,&#8221; and says it is known in the
South as &#8220;Dab and Stick.&#8221; The author adds, &#8220;May not
&#8216;tribbit,&#8217; or &#8216;trevit,&#8217; be a corruption of &#8216;three feet,&#8217; the required
length of the stick for pliable adaptation?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robinson (<i>Mid-Yorkshire Glossary</i>), under &#8220;Spell and Nur,&#8221;
says: &#8220;A game played with a wooden ball and a stick fitted
at the striking end with a club-shaped piece of wood. The
&#8217;spell&#8217; made to receive and spring the ball for the blow at a
touch, is a simple contrivance of wood an inch or so in breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_423" id="PageI_423">[423]</a></span>
and a few inches long.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The players, who usually go in and
out by turns each time, after a preliminary series of tippings of
the spell with the stick in one hand, and catches of the ball
with the other, in the process of calculating the momentum
necessary for reach of hand, are also allowed two trial &#8216;rises&#8217;
in a striking attitude, and distance is reckoned by scores of
yards. The long pliable stick, with a loose club end, used in
the game, is called the &#8216;tribit&#8217; or &#8216;trivit&#8217; stick.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The trevit
is, in fact, the trap itself, and the trevit-stick the stick with
which the trap is struck.&#8221; The tribbit-stick is elsewhere called
&#8220;primstick,&#8221; &#8220;gelstick,&#8221; &#8220;buckstick,&#8221; &#8220;trippit,&#8221; and &#8220;trevit.&#8221;
Atkinson says that &#8220;spell&#8221; is O.N., &#8220;spill&#8221; meaning a play or
game, and the probability is that the game is a lineal descendant
from the Ball-play of the Old Danes, or Northmen, and Icelanders.
&#8220;Spell and knor&#8221; is a corruption of &#8220;spell a&#8217; knor,&#8221; the
play at ball. Nurspel is simply ball-play, therefore which name,
taken in connection with the fact that the game is elsewhere
called &#8220;Spell and Knor,&#8221; and not &#8220;Knor and Spell,&#8221; is significant.
There is one day in the year, Shrove Tuesday, when the
play is customarily practised, though not quite exclusively.&mdash;Atkinson&#8217;s
<i>Cleveland Glossary</i>.</p>

<p>Easther (<i>Almondbury Glossary</i>) describes it as played with a
wooden ball, a spel, and a pommel. Two may play, or two
sides. When a player goes in he drives the knor for, say, 100
yards, <i>i.e.</i>, five score, and he reckons five. Each person has
the same number of strokes previously agreed upon, but generally
only one innings. The &#8220;spell&#8221; is a kind of stage with
three or four feet, to drive it into the ground. On the top of
this stage is a spring made of steel, containing a cup to receive
the &#8220;knor,&#8221; which is about one or two inches in diameter, and
is made of holly or box. The spring is kept down by a sneck,
which is tapped by the pommel when the knor is intended to be
struck. The pommel is thus formed&mdash;the driving part is frequently
of ash-root or owler, in shape like half a sugar-loaf
split lengthwise, but only three or four inches long, and the
handle is of ash, wrapped with a wax band where held, which
is in one hand only.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The children form in two lines of equal length, facing one
another, with sufficient space between the lines to admit of their
walking in line backwards and forwards towards and away from
each other, as each line sings the verses allotted to it (<a href="#IlloNuts">fig. 1</a>).
The first line sings the first, third, and fifth verses, and the
opposite line the second and fourth. At the end of the fifth verse
a handkerchief or other mark is laid on the ground, and the
two children (whose names have been mentioned, and who are
as evenly matched as possible), take each other&#8217;s right hand
and endeavour to pull each other over the handkerchief to their
own side (<a href="#IlloNuts">fig. 2</a>). The child who is pulled over the handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_429" id="PageI_429">[429]</a></span>
becomes the &#8220;captured nut,&#8221; and joins the side of her capturers.
Then the game begins again by the second line singing the
first, third, and fifth verses, while advancing to gather or capture
the &#8220;nuts,&#8221; the first line responding with the second and fourth
verses, and the same finish as before. Then the first line
begins the game, and so on until all the children are in this
way matched one against the other.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Other versions have been sent me, with slight variations:

&#8220;We&#8217;ve picked [Sally Gray] for nuts in May,&#8221; &#8220;All on a
summer&#8217;s morning,&#8221; Sheffield (Mr. S. O. Addy). A version
by Miss Kimber (Newbury, Berks, and Marlborough, Wilts)
ends each verse, &#8220;Nuts and May.&#8221; In other respects these
variants are practically the same. Printed versions not given
above are Hersham, Surrey (<i>Folk-lore Record</i>, v. 85); Burne&#8217;s
<i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, p. 516; Sulhampstead, Berks (<i>Antiquary</i>,
vol. xxvii., Miss E. E. Thoyts); and Dorsetshire, &#8220;Gathering
nuts away&#8221; (<i>Folk-lore Journal</i>, vii. 225). From Longcot,
Berks, a version sent me by Miss I. Barclay has no fourth line
to the verses.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) This game is probably, unless we except &#8220;<a href="#GameI_429">Mulberry
Bush</a>,&#8221; the most popular and the most widely played of any
singing game. It might almost be called universal. This is
shown by the fact that there are few counties where it is not
known, and also that important variants, either in the words or
in the method of playing, are rarely met with. In all the versions
which have been sent there are only the following variations
in the words, and these are principally in the refrain, or
last line of each verse: &#8220;On a cold and frosty morning&#8221; ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_430" id="PageI_430">[430]</a></span>
by far the greater number of versions; &#8220;On a fine summer&#8217;s
morning,&#8221; &#8220;So early in the morning,&#8221; &#8220;All on a summer&#8217;s
morning,&#8221; &#8220;Five o&#8217;clock in the morning,&#8221; &#8220;On a cold and
sunny morning,&#8221; coming next in number. The Belfast version
ends, &#8220;May! May! May!&#8221; and a Newbury and Marlborough
fourth line is simply a repetition of the second, &#8220;Nuts in May,
nuts in May.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the first line of the verse the only important variant seems
to be the <a href="#NutsSymondsbury">Symondsbury</a> &#8220;Gathering nuts away&#8221; and &#8220;Gathering
nuts to-day.&#8221; &#8220;Gathering nuts away&#8221; also occurs in one
<a href="#NutsNewbury">version from Newbury</a> (Berks), &#8220;Nuts and May&#8221; appearing
in the larger number after the more usual &#8220;Nuts in May.&#8221; In
only one version is a specific place mentioned for the gathering.
This is in the <a href="#NutsBocking">Bocking version</a>, where Galloway Hill is named,
in reply to the unusual question, &#8220;Where do you gather your
nuts in May?&#8221; A player is usually gathered for &#8220;Nuts in
May.&#8221; In three or four cases only is this altered to gathering
a player&#8217;s &#8220;nuts away,&#8221; which is obviously an alteration to try
and make the action coincide exactly with the words. The
game is always played in &#8220;lines,&#8221; and the principal incidents
running throughout all the versions are the same, <i>i.e.</i>, one
player is selected by one line of players from their opponents&#8217;
party. The &#8220;selected&#8221; one is refused by her party unless
some one from the opposite side can effect her capture by a
contest of strength. In all versions but two or three this contest
takes place between the two; in one or two all the players
join in the trial of strength. In another instance there appears
to be no contest, but the selected player crosses over to the
opposite side. Two important incidents occur in the <a href="#NutsBocking">Bocking</a>
and <a href="#NutsSymondsbury">Symondsbury versions</a>. In the <a href="#NutsBocking">Bocking</a> game the side which
is victorious has the right to begin the next game first: this
also occurs in the Barnes version. In <a href="#NutsSymondsbury">Symondsbury</a>, when
one child is drawn over the boundary line by one from the
opposite side she has to be &#8220;crowned&#8221; immediately. This is
done by the conqueror putting her hand on the captured one&#8217;s
head. If this is not done at once the captured one is at liberty
to return to her own side. In some versions (Shropshire and
London) the player who is selected for &#8220;Nuts&#8221; is always captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_431" id="PageI_431">[431]</a></span>
by the one sent to fetch her. Some Barnes children
also say that this is the proper way to play. When boys and
girls play the boys are always sent to &#8220;fetch away&#8221; the girls.
In Sheffield (a version collected by Mr. S. O. Addy) a boy is
chosen to fetch the girl away; and in the Earls Heaton version
the line runs, &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a girl for nuts in May.&#8221;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) There is some analogy in the game to marriage by capture,
and to the marriage customs practised at May Day festivals
and gatherings. For the evidence for marriage by capture in
the game there is no element of love or courtship, though there
is the obtaining possession of a member of an opposing party.
But it differs from ordinary contest-games in the fact that
one party does not wage war against another party for possession
of a particular piece of ground, but individual against
individual for the possession of an individual. That the player
sent to fetch the selected girl is expected to conquer seems to
be implied&mdash;first, by a choice of a certain player being made
to effect the capture; secondly, by the one sent &#8220;to fetch&#8221;
being always successful; and thirdly, the &#8220;crowning&#8221; in the
<a href="#NutsSymondsbury">Symondsbury game</a>. Through all the games I have seen
played this idea seems to run, and it exactly accords with the
conception of marriage by capture. For examples of the actual
survivals in English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish customs of
marriage by capture see Gomme&#8217;s <i>Folk-lore Relics of Early
Village Life</i>, pp. 204-210.</p>

<p>The question is, How does this theory of the origin of the
game fit in with the term &#8220;Nuts in May&#8221;? I attribute this
to the gathering by parties of young men of bunches of May at
the May festivals and dances, to decorate not only the Maypole,
May &#8220;kissing-bush,&#8221; but the doors of houses. &#8220;Knots
of May&#8221; is a term used by children, meaning bunches of May.
Thus, a note by Miss Fowler in the MS. of the games she had
collected says, &#8220;In Bucks the children speak of &#8216;knots of May,&#8217;
meaning each little bunch of hawthorn blossom.&#8221; The gathering
of bunches of May by parties of young men and maidens
to make the May-bush round which the May Day games were
held, and dancing and courting, is mentioned by Wilde (<i>Irish
Popular Superstitions</i>, p. 52), the game being &#8220;Dance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_432" id="PageI_432">[432]</a></span>
Ring.&#8221; Holland (<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>) says, &#8220;May birches were
branches of different kinds of trees fastened over doors of
houses and on the chimney on the eve of May Day. They
were fastened up by parties of young men who went round
for the purpose, and were intended to be symbolical of the
character of the inmates.&#8221; I remember one May Day in London,
when the &#8220;May girls&#8221; came with a garland and short sticks
decorated with green and bunches of flowers, they sang<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Knots of May we&#8217;ve brought you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before your door it stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is but a sprout, but it&#8217;s well budded out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the work of the Lord&#8217;s hands,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and a Miss Spencer, who lived near Hampton (Middlesex),
told me that she well remembered the May girls singing the
first verse of this carol, using &#8220;knots&#8221; instead of the more
usual word &#8220;branch&#8221; or &#8220;bunch,&#8221; and that she knew the
small bunch of May blossom by the name of &#8220;knots&#8221; of
May, &#8220;bringing in knots of May&#8221; being a usual expression
of children.</p>

<p>The association of May&mdash;whether the month, or the flower,
or both&mdash;with the game is very strong, the refrain &#8220;cold and
frosty morning,&#8221; &#8220;all on a summer&#8217;s morning,&#8221; &#8220;bright summer&#8217;s
morning,&#8221; &#8220;so early in the morning,&#8221; also being characteristic
of the early days of May and spring, and suggests that
the whole day from early hours is given up to holiday. The
familiar nursery rhyme given by Halliwell<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here we come a-piping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First in spring and then in May,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>no doubt also refers to house-to-house visiting of May.</p>

<p>The connection between the May festival and survival in
custom of marriage by capture is well illustrated by a passage
from Stubbe&#8217;s <i>Anatomie of Abuses</i>, p. 148. He says: &#8220;Against
May Day, Whitsonday, or other time, euery Parishe, Towne and
Village assemble themselves together, bothe men women and
children, olde and yong, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and either goyng all together
or diuidyng themselues into companies, they goe some to the
Woodes and groves where they spend all the night in plesant
pastimes; and in the morning they return bringing with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="PageI_433" id="PageI_433">[433]</a></span>
birch and branches of trees to deck their assemblies withall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
then they fall to daunce about it like as the heathen
people did.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have heard it credibly reported (and that
<i>viva voce</i>) by men of great grauitie and reputation, that of
fortie, threescore or a hundred maides going to the wood ouer
night, there haue scaresly the third part of them returned home
againe undefiled.&#8221; Herrick&#8217;s <i>Hesperides</i> also describes the
festival, and the custom of courting and marriage at the same
time.</p>

<h2><a name="TN" id="TN"></a>Transcriber&#8217;s notes:</h2>

<p><b>General:</b><br />
This is Volume I of a two-volume work. Where necessary, hyperlinks are provided to Volume II, but these may not work on all platforms. Because Volume I was published in 1894 and Volume II in 1898, there is no symmetry in the references between the two volumes (for example, Gled Wylie from Volume I does not refer to Shue-Gled-Wylie from Volume II, whereas Shue-Gled-Wylie does refer to Gled Wylie).<br />
In the Addenda in Volume II the author has added to the description of some of the games. Where this is the case, a hyperlink <sup>[Addendum]</sup> has been provided. Some descriptions have more than one addition; in these cases, there is a separate hyperlink for each addendum.<br />
This eBook contains a number of symbols and characters that may not display properly, depending on the software used and its settings.<br />
Midi files have been provided to play the tunes. Playing these files may not work on all devices, depending on the hard- and software used.<br />
The tables with analyses of the rhymes have been re-arranged to better convey their meaning; they are sometimes very wide and may require horizontal scrolling, depending on the hard- and software used for reading.<br />
This text follows the original printed work, including inconsistencies. Inconsistencies include differences in spelling of the names of games and locations, differences in transcription of dialect, inconsistencies in lay-out, etc. Where changes were made, these are documented below. </p>

<p><b>References and hyperlinks:</b><br />
The book contains some uncertain references to games, because of inconsistent naming and/or spelling of game names. Where these differences were trivial (for example, Wolf and Lamb versus Wolf and the Lamb), their identity has been assumed silently. Following is a list of less trivial differences:</p>
<ul class="tn">
<li>The game Stag (Vol. II) is often referred to in the text as Stag Warning; occasionally they are listed as though they were separate games. The hyperlinks point to Stag.</li>
<li>Page 51: reference to Wind Up Jack; this game is not mentioned separately, but under Wind Up the Bush Faggot (which is where the hyperlink points).</li>
<li>Page 120: reference to Wind up the Watch, which is not listed as a separate game, but as a local name for Wind up the Bush Faggot (to which the reference links).</li>
<li>Page 137: reference to Crosspurposes, which is not listed as a separate game; according to the description and  Vol. II, this is probably Cross-questions, which is where the link points.</li>
<li>Page 300: reference to How many miles to Barley Bridge?, which is not listed as a separate game; the phrase occurs in some of the versions of How many miles to Babylon?, to which the hyperlink points.</li>
<li>Page 318, section (c): The author refers to the Belfast version, but describes the Isle of Man version. This has not been changed.</li>
<li>Page 328: reference to the game Spanish Fly, which does not occur in either volume (nor does the phrase).</li>
<li>Page 361: Lubin, Looby Loo has a hyperlink to the Addenda; the game is not listed as such in the Addenda, the link points to Hulla-balloo-ballee which is apparently the intended reference.</li>
<li>Page 402: reference to Ghost in the Garden and Ghost in the Copper. Neither is described as a separate game; probably the reference is to Ghost at the Well, to which the link points.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes on the music transcriptions:</b></p>
<ul class="tn">
<li>Page 15 (Ball of Primrose): In the last bar, the dotted half-note is erroneous and has been changed to an undotted half-note.</li>
<li>Page 28 (Betsy Bungay): 5th note of third bar should be a dotted quaver not a dotted crotchet; top bar is missing.</li>
<li>Page 44 (Boys and Girls): Bar 1: note values do not add up to time signature. Crotchet rest inserted to make it correct length. Bar 14: note values do not add up to time signature; should be same rhythm as bar 16- i.e. two dotted minims.</li>
<li>Page 52 (Bung the Bucket): The key signature shows that this should be in the treble not the bass clef. Bar 1:note values do not add up to time signature. Either the first crotchet should not be dotted or the quaver or the semiquavers are redundant. It seems to work best by changing the dotted crotchet to a crotchet.</li>
<li>Page 87 (Currants and Raisins): The second section (bars 5-12) has repeat marks but the written guidance is to play it once. The repeat signs from this section are not used in the Midi music. The third section starting at bar 13 is more like a new beginning as it starts with an uptake bar of just one crotchet which is balanced at the end of the section with a minim. To keep it as a single piece, two crotchet rests have been added at the beginning of bar thirteen and a crotchet rest at the end of the last bar. Since this section is to be repeated as often as is required, these rests would not be out of place in the performance.</li>
<li>Page 100 (Draw a Pail of Water): The note values in bar 1 add up to 5 crotchets instead of four. Following the pattern of the second and third bars, the first note of bar one has been changed from a dotted crotchet to a dotted quaver and the second note from a quaver to a semi-quaver.</li>
<li>Page 113 (Duck Dance): In the midi file, just the first and the last verses are played. The first five bars represent one verse and are repeated just once followed by the last two bars for which the direction is that they are for the last verse only. In the fifth full bar, the fourth note value is a redundant crotchet rest since there is an uptake bar of one crotchet that this bar should balance.</li>
<li>Page 153 (Green Grass, Middlesex): Two bars rest have been inserted after bar 24 and at the end for the spoken sections.</li>
<li>Page 153 (Green Grass, London): Bar 5 is marked as the start of a repeat but there is no end repeat sign at the double bar-line in bar 8. This section should presumably be repeated. Bar 9 contains just one quaver so rests have been inserted at the beginning of the bar to make up the full bar.</li>
<li>Page 171 (Green Gravel, Derbyshire): 5<sup>th</sup> full bar is missing half a beat. The last two semiquavers in this bar have been transcribed as quavers to correct this.</li>
<li>Page 205 (Here we go around, around): Although first time and second time bars are shown, no repeat marks are given. These have been inserted after the uptake bar and at the end of the first time bar.</li>
<li>Page 293 (Jolly Rover): The third note of the penultimate bar is written as an F natural. This sounds very odd. It may be that it is a misprint for F sharp. Two midi files are therefore provided, one as written, and another in which the F natural is replaced by an F sharp.</li>
<li>Page 313 (Lady of the Land): 4th full bar 3rd note: this needs to be a dotted crotchet not a minim to make up the correct number of beats to the bar. Similarly the first note of the 5th full bar and the last note of the 6th full bar should be dotted crotchets not dotted minims. However it is possible that in performance, these notes should sound longer. Therefore, two midi files are provided. The first is as changed to make up the correct number of beats to the bar to fit the time signature. In the second, pauses over the &#8220;incorrect&#8221; notes have been included.</li>
<li>Page 333 (London Bridge, Enborne School): The penultimate bar shows two dotted minims. To make the correct time values for the bar these should be two dotted crotchets. As in Lady of the Land, however, the longer notes may simply indicate pauses over each as in the alternative version.</li>
